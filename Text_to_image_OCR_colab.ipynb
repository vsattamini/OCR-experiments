       "'MA DWN E\\n\\n \\n\\n\"Superb scholarship rendered with\\n\\x0c PREFACE\\n\\nPascat: “Men are so necessarily mad, that not to be mad\\nwould amount to another form of madness.” And Dostoievsky, in bis piany oF A writer: “It is not by confining\\none’s neighbor that one is convinced of one’s own sanity.”\\n\\nWe have yet to write the history of that other form of\\nmadness, by which men, in an act of sovereign reason, confine their neighbors, and communicate and recognize each\\nother through the merciless language of non-madness; to\\ndefine the moment of this conspiracy before it was permanently established in the realm of truth, before it was revived by the lyricism of protest. We must try to return, in\\nhistory, to that zero point in the course of madness at\\nwhich madness is an undifferentiated experience, a not yet\\ndivided experience of division itself. We must describe,\\nfrom the start of its trajectory, that “other form” whicb\\nrelegates Reason and Madness to one side or the other of its\\naction as things henceforth external, deaf to all exchange,\\nand as though dead to one another.\\n\\nThis is doubtless an uncomfortable region. To explore it\\nwe must renounce the convenience of terminal truths, and\\nnever let ourselves be guided by what we may know of\\nmadness. None of the concepts of psychopathology, even\\nand especially in the implicit process of retrospections, can\\nplay an organizing role. What is constitutive is the action\\nthat divides madness, and not the science elaborated once\\nthis division is made and calm restored. What is originative\\nis the caesura that establishes the distance between reason\\nand non-reason; reason’s subjugation of non-reason, wrest\\n(iz)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c IV\\n\\nSete\\ncae\\nPASSION AND\\nDELIRIUM\\n\\nTue savage danger of madness is related to the danger of\\nthe passions and to their fatal concatenation,\\n\\nSauvages had sketched the fundamental role of passion,\\nciting it as a more constant, more persistent, and somehow\\nmore deserved cause of madness: “The distraction of our\\nmind is the result of our blind surrender to our desires, our\\nincapacity to control or to moderate our passions. Whence\\nthese amorous frenzies, these antipathies, these depraved\\ntastes, this melancholy which is caused by grief, these\\ntransports wrought in us by denial, these excesses in eating,\\nin drinking, these indispositions, these corporeal vices which\\ncause madness, the worst of all maladies.”* But as yet, what\\nwas involved was only passion’s moral precedence, its responsibility, in a vague way; the real target of this denunciation was the radical relation of the phenomena of madness\\nto the very possibility of passion.\\n\\n(8s)\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nBefore Descartes, and long after his influence as philosopher and physiologist had diminished, passion continued to\\nbe the meeting ground of body and soul; the point where\\nthe latter’s activity makes contact with the former’s passivity, each being a limit imposed upon the other and the locus\\nof their communication.\\n\\nThe medicine of humors sees this unity primarily as a\\nreciprocal interaction: “The passions necessarily cause certain movements in the humors; anger agitates the bile, sadness excites melancholy (black bile), and the movements\\nof the humors are on occasion so violent that they disrupt\\nthe entire economy of the body, even causing death; further, the passions augment the quantity of the humors;\\nanger multiplies the bile as sadness increases melancholy.\\nThe humors which are customarily agitated by certain passions dispose those in whom they abound to the same\\npassions, and to thinking of the objects which ordinarily\\nexcite them; bile disposes to anger and to thinking of those\\nwe hate. Melancholy (black bile) disposes to sadness and\\nto thinking of untoward things; well-tempered blood disposes to joy.”\\n\\nThe medicine of spirits substitutes for this vague idea of\\n“disposition” the rigor of 2 physical, mechanical transmission of movements. If the passions are possible only in 2\\nbeing which has a body, and a body not entirely subject to\\nthe light of its mind and to the immediate transparence of\\nits will, this is true insofar as, in ourselves and without\\nourselves, and generally in spite of ourselves, the mind’s\\nmovements obey a mechanical structure which is that of\\nthe movement of spirits. “Before the sight of the object of\\npassion, the animal spirits were spread throughout the enure body in order to preserve all the parts in general; but at\\nthe presence of the new object, this entire economy is disrupted. The majority of spirits are impelled into the\\nmuscles of the arms, the legs, the face, and all the exterior\\n\\n(86)\\n\\x0c     \\n\\n \\n   \\n\\nPassion and Delirium\\n\\nparts of the body in order to afford it a disposition proper\\nto the prevailing passion and to give it the countenance and\\nmovement necessary for the acquisition of the good or the\\nescape from the evil which presents irself.”® Passion thus\\ndisperses the spirits, which are disposed to passion: that is,\\nunder the effect of passion and in the presence of its object,\\nthe spirits circulate, disperse, and concentrate according to a\\nspatial design which licenses the trace of the object in the\\nbrain and its image in the soul, thus forming in the body a\\nkind of geometric figure of passion which is merely its expressive transposition; but which also constitutes passion’s\\nessential causal basis, for when all the spirits are grouped\\naround this object of passion, or at least around its image,\\nthe mind in its turn can no longer ignore it and will consequently be subject to passion.\\n\\nOne more step, and the entire system becomes a unity in\\nwhich body and soul communicate immediately in the symbolic values of common qualities. This is what happens in\\nthe medicine of solids and fluids, which dominates eighteenth-century practice. Tension and release, hardness and\\nsoftness, rigidity and relaxation, congestion and dryness—\\nthese qualitative states characterize the soul as much as the\\nbody, and ultimately refer to a kind of indistinct and composite passional situation, one which imposes itself on the\\nconcatenation of ideas, on the course of feelings, on the\\nstate of fibers, on the circulation of fluids. The theme of\\ncausality here appears as too discursive, the elements it\\ngroups too disjunct for its schemas to be applicable. Are\\nthe “active passions, such as anger, joy, lust,” causes or\\nconsequences “of the excessive strength, the excessive tension, and the excessive elasticity of the nervous fibers, and\\nof the excessive activity of the nervous fluid”? Conversely,\\ncannot the “inert passions, such as fear, depression, ennui,\\nlack of appetite, the coldness that accompanies homesickness, bizarre appetites, stupidiry, lack of memory” be as\\n\\n(87)\\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nreadily followed as they are preceded by “weakness of the\\nbrain marrow and of the nervous fibers distributed in the\\norgans, by impoverishment and inertia of the fluids”?* Indeed, we must no longer try to situate passion in a causal\\nsuccession, or halfway between the corporeal and the spiritual; passion indicates, at a new, deeper level, that the soul\\nand the body are in a perpetual metaphorical relation in\\nwhich qualities have no need to be communicated because\\nthey are already common to both; and in which phenomena of expression are not causes, quite simply because\\nsoul and body are always each other’s immediate expression. Passion is no longer exactly at the geometrical center\\nof the body-and-soul complex; it is, a little short of that, at\\nthe point where their opposition is not yet given, in that\\nregion where both their unity and their distinction are established.\\n\\nBut at this level, passion is no fonger simply one of the\\ncauses—however powerful—of madness; rather it forms\\nthe basis for its very possibility. If it is true that there exists\\na realm, in the relations of soul and body, where cause and\\neffect, determinism and expression still intersect in a web so\\ndense that they actually form only one and the same movement which cannot be dissociated except after the fact; if it\\nis true that prior to the violence of the body and the vivacity of the soul, prior to the softening of the fibers and che\\nrelaxation of the mind, there are qualitative, as yet unshared kinds of @ priori which subsequently impose the\\nsame values on the organic and on the spiritual, then we see\\nthat there can be diseases such as madness which are from\\nthe start diseases of the body and of the soul, maladies in\\nwhich the affection of the brain is of the same quality, of\\nthe same origin, of the same nature, finally, as the affection\\nof the soul.\\n\\nThe possibility of madness is therefore implicit in the\\nvery phenomenon of passion.\\n\\n(88)\\n\\x0c Passion and Delirium\\n\\nTr is true that long before the eighteenth century, and for\\na long series of centuries from which we have doubtless not\\nemerged, passion and madness were kept in close relation to\\none another. But let us allow the classical period its originality. The moralists of the Greco-Latin tradition had found\\nit just that madness be passion’s chastisement; and to be\\nmore certain that this was the case, they chose to define\\npassion as a temporary and attenuated madness. But classical thought could define a relation between passion and\\nmadness which was not on the order of a pious hope, a\\npedagogic threat, or a moral synthesis; it even broke with\\nthe tradition by inverting the terms of the concatenation; it\\nbased the chimeras of madness on the nature of passion; it\\nsaw that the determinism of the passions was nothing but a\\nchance for madness to penetrate the world of reason; and\\nthat if the unquestioned union of body and soul manifested\\nman’s finitude in passion, it laid this same man open, at the\\nsame time, to the infinite movement that destroyed him.\\n\\nMadness, then, was not merely one of the possibilities\\nafforded by the union of soul and body; it was not just\\none of the consequences of passion. Instiruted by the unity\\nof soul and body, madness turned against that unity and\\nonce again put it in question, Madness, made possible by\\npassion, threatened by a movement proper to itself what\\nhad made passion itself possible. Madness was one of those\\nunities in which laws were compromised, perverted,\\ndistorted—thereby manifesting such unity as evident and\\nestablished, but also as fragile and already doomed to destruction.\\n\\nThere comes a moment in the course of passion when\\nlaws are suspended as though of their own accord, when\\nmovement either abruptly stops, without collision or absorption of any kind of active force, or is propagated, the\\naction ceasing only at the climax of the paroxysm. Whytt\\nadmits that an intense emotion can provoke madness ex\\n(89)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavNESS & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nactly as impact can provoke movement, for the sole reason\\nthat emotion is both impact in the soul and agitation of the\\nnervous fiber: “It is thus that sad narratives or those capable of moving the heart, a horrible and unexpected sight,\\ngreat grief, rage, terror, and the other passions which\\nmake a great impression frequently occasion the most sudden and violent nervous symptoms.” But—it is here that\\nmadness, strictly speaking, begins—it happens that this\\nmovement immediately cancels itself out by its own excess\\nand abruptly provokes an immobility which may reach the\\npoint of death itself. As if in the mechanics of madness,\\nTepose were not necessarily a quiescent thing but could also\\nbe a movement in violent opposition to itself, a movement\\nwhich under the effect of its own violence abruptly\\nachieves contradiction and the impossibility of contnuance. “It is not unheard of that the passions, being very\\nviolent, generate a kind of tetanus or catalepsy such that\\nthe person then resembles a statue more than a living being.\\nFurther, fear, affliction, joy, and shame carried to their excess have more than once been followed by sudden\\ndeath.”®\\n\\nConversely, it happens that movement, passing from soul\\nto body and from body to soul, propagates itself indefinitely in a locus of anxiety certainly closer to that space\\nwhere Malebranche placed souls than to that in which Descartes situated bodies. Imperceptible movements, often provoked by a slight external impact, accumulate, are amplified, and end by exploding in violent convulsions. Giovanni\\nMaria Lancisi had already explained that the noble Romans\\nwere often subject to the vapors—hysterical attacks, hypochondriacal fits—because in their court life “their minds,\\ncontinually agitated between fear and hope, never knew a\\nmoment\\'s repose.” According to many physicians, cicy life,\\nthe life of the court, of the salons, led to madness by this\\nmultiplicity of excitations constantly accumulated, pro\\n(90)\\n\\x0c  \\n\\nPassion and Delirium\\n\\nlonged, and echoed without ever being attenuated. But\\nthere is in this image, in its more intense forms, and in the\\nevents constituting its organic version, a certain force\\nwhich, increasing, can lead to delirium, as if movement, instead of losing its strength in communicating itself, could\\ninvolve other forces in its wake, and from them derive an\\nadditional vigor. This was how Sauvages explained the\\norigin of madness: a certain impression of fear is linked to\\nthe congestion or the pressure of 2 certain medullary fiber;\\nthis fear is limited to an object, as this congestion is strictly\\nlocalized. In proportion as this fear persists, the soul grants\\nit more attention, increasingly isolating and detaching it\\nfrom all else. But such isoladon reinforces the fear, and the\\nsoul, having accorded it too special a condition, gradually\\ntends to attach to it a whole series of more or less remote\\nideas: “It joins to this simple idea all those which are likely\\nto nourish and augment it. For example, a man who supposes in his sleep that he is being accused of a crime, immediately associates this idea with that of its satellites—\\njudges, executioners, the gibbet.” And from being thus\\nburdened with all these new elements, involving them in its\\ncourse, the idea assumes a kind of additional power which\\nultimately renders it irresistible even to the most concerted\\nefforts of the will.\\n\\nMadness, which finds its first possibility in the phenomenon of passion, and in the deployment of thar double causality which, starting from passion itself, radiates both toward the body and toward the soul, is at the same time\\nsuspension of passion, breach of causality, dissolution of the\\nelements of this unity. Madness participates both in the\\nnecessity of passion and in the anarchy of what, released by\\nthis very passion, transcends it and ultimately contests all it\\nimplies. Madness ends by being a movement of the nerves\\nand muscles so violent that nothing in the course of images,\\nideas, or wills seems to correspond to it: this is the case of\\n\\n(97)\\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMapness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nmania when it is suddenly intensified into convulsions, or\\nwhen it degenerates into continuous frenzy. Conversely,\\nmadness can, in the body’s repose or inertia, generate and\\nthen maintain an agitation of the soul, without pause or\\npacification, as is the case in melancholia, where external\\nobjects do not produce the same impression on the sufferer’s mind as on that of a healthy man; “his impressions are\\nweak and he rarely pays attention to them; his mind is\\nalmost totally absorbed by the vivacity of certain ideas.”*\\n\\nIndeed this dissociation between the external movements\\nof the body and the course of ideas does not mean that the\\nunity of body and soul is necessarily dissolved, nor that\\neach recovers its autonomy in madness. Doubtless the unity\\nis compromised in its rigor and in its totality; but it is fissured, it turns out, along lines which do not abolish it, but\\ndivide it into arbitrary sectors. For when melancholia fixes\\nupon an aberrant idea, it is not only the soul which is\\ninvolved; it is the soul with the brain, the soul with the\\nnerves, their origin and their fibers: a whole segment of the\\nunity of soul and body is thus detached from the aggregate\\nand especially from the organs by which reality is perceived. The same thing occurs in convulsions and agitation:\\nthe soul is not excluded from the body, but is swept along\\nso rapidly by it that it cannot retain all its conceptions; it is\\nseparated from its memories, its intentions, its firmest ideas,\\nand thus isolated from itself and from all chat remains stable\\nin the body, it surrenders itself to the most mobile fibers;\\nnothing in its behavior is henceforth adapted to reality, to\\ntruth, or to prudence; though the fibers in their vibration\\nmay imitate what is happening in the perceptions, the\\nsufferer cannot tell the difference: “The rapid and chaotic\\npulsations of the arteries, or whatever other derangement\\noccurs, imprints this same movement on the fibers (as in\\nperception); they will represent as present objects which\\nare not so, as true those which are chimerical.””\\n\\n(92)\\n\\x0c  \\n\\n \\n\\nPassion and Delirium\\n\\nIn madness, the totality of soul and body is parceled out:\\nnot according to the elements which constitute that totality\\nmetaphysically; but according to figures, images which envelop segments of the body and ideas of the soul in a kind\\nof absurd unity. Fragments which isolate man from himself, but above all from reality; fragments which, by detaching themselves, have formed the unreal unity of a hallucination, and by very virtue of this autonomy impose it\\nupon truth, “Madness is no more than the derangement of\\nthe imagination.”* In other words, beginning with passion,\\nmadness is still only an intense movement in the rational\\nunity of soul and body; this is the level of unreason; but\\nthis intense movement quickly escapes the reason of the\\nmechanism and becomes, in its violences, its stupors, its\\nsenseless propagations, an irrational movement; and it is\\nthen that, escaping truth and its constraints, the Unreal\\nappears.\\n\\nAnd thereby we find the suggestion of the third cycle\\n‘we must now trace: that of chimeras, of hallucinations, and\\nof error—the cycle of non-being.\\n\\nLer us listen to what is said in these fantastic fragments.\\n\\nImagination is not madness. Even if in the arbitrariness of hallucination, alienation finds the first access to\\nits vain liberty, madness begins only beyond this point,\\nwhen the mind binds itself to this arbitrariness and becomes\\na prisoner of this apparent liberty. At the moment he wakes\\nfrom a dream, a man can indeed observe: “I am imagining\\nthat I am dead”: he thereby. denounces and measures the\\narbitrariness of the imagination—he is not mad. He is mad\\nwhen he posits as an affirmation of his death--when he\\nsuggests as having some value as truth—the still-neutral\\ncontent of the image “I am dead.” And just as the consciousness of truth is not carried away by the mere presence of the image, but in the act which limits, confronts,\\n\\n(93)\\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nunifies, or dissociates the image, so madness will begin only\\nin the act which gives the value of truth to the image.\\nThere is an original innocence of the imagination: “The\\nimagination itself does not err, since it neither denies nor\\naffirms but is fixed to so great a degree on the simple contemplation of an image”; and only the mind can curn what\\nis given in the image into abusive truth, in other words, into\\nerror, or acknowledged error, that is, into truth: “A drunk\\nman thinks he sees two candles where there is but one; a\\nman who has a strabismus and whose mind is cultivated\\nimmediately acknowledges his error and accustoms himself\\nto see but one.”?° Madness is thus beyond imagination, and\\nyet it is profoundly rooted in it; for it consists merely in\\nallowing the image a spontaneous value, total and absolute\\ntruth. The act of the reasonable man who, rightly or\\nwrongly, judges an image to be true or false, is beyond this\\nimage, transcends and measures it by what is not itself; the\\nact of the madman never oversteps the image presented,\\nbut surrenders to its immediacy, and affirms it only insofar\\nis it is enveloped by it: “Many persons, not to say all, succumb to madness only from being too concerned about an\\nobject.”\"\" Inside the image, confiscated by it, and incapable of escaping from it, madness is nonetheless more than\\nimagination, forming an act of undetermined content.\\nWhat is this act? An act of faith, an act of affirmation\\nand of negation—a discourse which sustains and at the same\\ntime erodes the image, undermines it, distends it in the\\ncourse of a reasoning, and organizes it around a segment of\\nlanguage. The man who imagines he is made of glass is not\\nmad, for any sleeper can have this image in a dream; but he\\nis mad if, believing he is made of glass, he thereby concludes that he is fragile, that he is in danger of breaking,\\nthat he must touch no object which might be too resistant,\\nthat he must in fact remain motionless, and so on. Such\\nreasonings are those of a madman; but again we must note\\n\\n(94)\\n\\x0c  \\n\\nPREFACE\\n\\ning from it its truth as madness, crime, or disease, derives\\nexplicitly from this point. Hence we must speak of that\\ninitial dispute without assuming a victory, or the right to a\\nvictory; we must speak of those actions re-examined in\\nhistory, leaving in abeyance all that may figure as a conclusion, as a refuge in truth; we shall have to speak of this\\nact of scission, of this distance set, of this void instituted\\nbetween reason and what is not reason, without ever relying upon the fulfillment of what it claims to be.\\n\\nThen, and then only, can we determine the realm in\\nwhich the man of madness and the man of reason, moving\\napart, are not yet disjunct; and in an incipient and very\\ncrude language, antedating that of science, begin the dialogue of their breach, testifying in a fugitive way that they\\nstill speak to each other. Here madness and non-madness,\\nreason and non-reason are inextricably involved: inseparable at the moment when they do not yet exist, and existing for each other, in relation to each other, in the exchange\\nwhich separates them.\\n\\nIn the serene world of mental illness, modern man no\\nlonger communicates with the madman: on one band, the\\nman of reason delegates the physician to madness, thereby\\nauthorizing a relation only through the abstract universality of disease; on the other, the man of madness communicates with society only by the intermediary of an equally\\nabstract reason which is order, physical and moral constraint, the anonymous pressure of the group, the requirements of conformity. As for a common language, there is\\nno such thing; or rather, there is no such thing any longer;\\nthe constitution of madness as a:mental illness, at the end of\\nthe eighteenth century, affords the evidence of a broken\\ndialogue, posits the separation as already effected, and\\nthrusts into oblivion all those stammered, imperfect words\\nwithout fixed syntax in which the exchange between madness and reason was made. The language of psychiatry,\\n\\n(x)\\n\\x0c Passion and Delirium\\n\\nthat in themselves they are neither absurd nor illogical. On\\nthe contrary, they apply correctly the most rigorous figures of logic. And Paul Zacchias has no difficulty finding\\nthem, in all their rigor, among the insane. Syllogism, in a\\nman letting himself starve to death: “The dead do not cat;\\nI am dead; hence I do not eat.” Induction extended to infiniry, in a man suffering from persecution delusions: “A,\\nB, and C are my enemies; all of them are men; therefore all\\nmen are my enemies.” Enthymeme, in another sufferer:\\n“Most of those who have lived in this house are dead, hence\\nI, who have lived in this house, am dead.” The marvelous\\nlogic of the mad which seems to mock that of the logicians\\nbecause it resembles it so exactly, or rather because it is\\nexactly the same, and because at the secret heart of mad~\\nness, at the core of so many errors, so many absurdities, so\\nmany words and gestures without consequence, we discover, finally, the hidden perfection of a language. “From\\nthese things,” Zacchias concludes, “you truly see how best\\nto discuss the intellect.” The ultimate language of madness\\nis that of reason, but the language of reason enveloped in\\nthe prestige of the image, limited to the locus of appearance\\nwhich the image defines. It forms, outside the totality of\\nimages and the universality of discourse, an abusive, singular organization whose insistent quality constitutes madness,\\nMadness, then, is not altogether in the image, which of\\nitself is neither true nor false, neither reasonable nor mad;\\nnor is it, further, in the reasoning which is mere form,\\nrevealing nothing but the indubitable figures of logic. And\\nyet madness is in one and in the other: in a special version\\nor figure of their relationship.\\n\\nLet us consider an example borrowed from Diemerbroek. A man was suffering from a profound melancholia.\\nAs with all melancholics, his mind was attached to a fixed\\nidea, and this idea was for him the occasion of a constantly\\nrenewed sadness. He accused himself of having killed his\\n\\n(95)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nson, and in the excess of his remorse, declared that God, for\\nhis punishment, had assigned a demon to tempt him, like\\nthe demon which had tempted the Lord. This demon he\\nsaw, spoke to, heard, and answered. He did not understand\\nwhy those around him refused to acknowledge such a presence. Such then is madness: this remorse, this belief, this\\nhallucination, these speeches; in short, this complex of convictions and images which constitutes a delirium. Now\\nDiemerbroek tries to find out what are the “causes” of this\\nmadness, how it can have originated, And this is what he\\nlearns; this man had taken his son bathing and the boy had\\ndrowned. Hence the father considered himself responsible\\nfor his son’s death. We can therefore reconstitute in the\\nfollowing manner the development of this madness: judging himself guilty, the man decides that homicide is execrable in the sight of God on High; whence it occurs to his\\nimagination that he is eternally damned; and since he\\n‘knows that the chief torment of damnation consists in being delivered into Satan’s hands, he tells himself “that a\\nhorrible demon is assigned to him.” This demon he does\\nnot as yet see, but since “the does not cease thinking of it,”\\nand “regards this notion as necessarily true,” he imposes on\\nhis brain a certain image of this demon; this image is presented to his soul by the action of the brain and of the\\nspirits with such insistence that he believes he continually\\nsees the demon itself,”\\n\\nHence madness, as analyzed by Diemerbrock, has two\\nlevels; one is manifest to all eyes: an unwarranted melancholia in a man who wrongly accuses himself of having\\nkilled his son; a depraved imagination which pictures demons; a dismantled reason which converses with a phantom. But at a deeper level, we find a rigorous organization\\ndependent on the faultless armature of a discourse. This\\ndiscourse, in its logic, commands the firmest belief in itself,\\nit advances by judgments and reasonings which connect\\n\\n(96)\\n\\x0c Passion and Delirium\\n\\ntogether; it is a kind of reason in action. In short, under the\\nchaotic and manifest delirium reigns the order of a secret\\ndelirium. In this second delirium, which is, in 2 sense, pure\\nreason, reason delivered of all the external tinsel of dementia, is located the paradoxical truth of madness. And this in\\na double sense, since we find here both what makes madness true (irrefutable logic, perfectly organized discourse,\\nfaultless connection in the transparency of a virtual language) and what makes it truly madness (its own nature,\\nthe special style of all its manifestations, and the internal\\nstructure of delirium).\\n\\nBut still more profoundly, this delirious language is the\\nultimate truth of madness insofar as it is madness’s organizing form, the determining principle of all its manifestations,\\nwhether of the body or of the soul. For if Diemerbroek’s\\nmelancholic converses with his demon, it is because the demon’s image has been profoundly impressed by the movement of spirits on the still-ductle substance of the brain.\\nBut in its turn, this organic figure is merely the other side of\\na preoccupation which has obsessed the patient’s mind; it\\nrepresents what might be called the sedimentation in the\\nbody of an infinitely repeated discourse apropos of the\\npunishment God must reserve for sinners guilty of homicide. The body and the traces it conceals, the soul and the\\nimages it perceives, are here no more than stages in the\\nsyntax of delirious language.\\n\\nAnd lest we be criticized for elaborating this entire analysis around a single observation from a single author (a\\nprivileged observation, since it concerns melancholic delirium), we shall also seek confirmation of the fundamental\\nrole of delirious discourse in the classical conception of\\nmadness in another author, of another period, and apropos\\nof a very different disease. This is a case of “nymphomania” observed by Bienville. The imagination of a young\\ngirl, “Julie,” had been inflamed by precocious reading and\\n\\n(97)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\naroused by the remarks of a servant girl “initiated into the\\nsecrets of Venus, . . . a virtuous handmaiden in the mother’s eyes” but “a dear and voluptuous stewardess of the\\ndaughter’s pleasures.” Yet Julie combats these—to her—\\nnew desires with all the impressions she has received in the\\ncourse of her education; to the seductive language of novels, she opposes the lessons of religion and virtue; and despite the vivacity of her imagination, she does not succumb\\nto disease so long as she possesses “the strength to reason\\nthus with herself; it is neither lawful nor virtuous to obey\\nso shameful a passion.”!* But the wicked remarks, the dangerous readings increase; at every moment, they render\\nmore intense the agitation of the weakening fibers; then the\\nfundamental language by which she had hitherto resisted\\ngradually gives way: “Nature alone had spoken hitherto;\\nbut soon illusion, chimera, and extravagance played their\\npart; at length she acquired the unhappy strength to approve in herself this horrible maxim: nothing is so beautiful\\nnor so sweet as to obey the desires of love.” This fundamental discourse opens the gates of madness: the imagina~\\ntion is freed, the appetites continually increase, the fibers\\nreach the final degree of irritation, Delirium, in its lapidary\\nform of a moral principle, leads straight to the convulsions\\nwhich can endanger life itself.\\n\\nAt the end of this last cycle which had begun with the\\nliberty of the hallucination and which closes now with the\\nrigor of delirious language, we can conclude:\\n\\n1. inmadness, for the classical age, there exist two forms\\nof delirium. A special, symptomatic form, proper to some\\nof the diseases of the mind and especially to melancholia; in\\nthis sense we can say that there are diseases with or without\\ndelirium. In any case, such delirium is always manifest; it\\nforms an integral part of the signs of madness; it is immanent to madness’s truth and constitutes only @ sector of it.\\nBut there exists another delirium which is not always mani\\n(98)\\n\\x0c  \\n\\n \\n\\nPassion and Delirium\\n\\nfest, which is not formulated by the sufferer himself in the\\ncourse of the disease, but which cannot fail to exist in the\\neyes of anyone who, seeking to trace the disease from its\\norigins, attempts to formulate its riddle and its truth.\\n\\n2. This implicit delirium exists in all the alterations of\\nthe mind, even where we would expect it least. In cases of\\nno more than silent gestures, wordless violence, oddities of\\nconduct, classical thought has no doubt that madness is\\ncontinually subjacent, relating each of these particular signs\\nto the general essence of madness. James’s Dictionary expressly urges us to consider as delirious “the sufferers who\\nsin by fault or excess in any of various voluntary actions, in\\n@ manner contrary to reason and to propriety; as when\\nthey use their hand, for example, to tear out tufts of wool\\nor in an action similar to that which serves to catch flies; or\\nwhen a patient acts against his custom and without cause,\\nor when he speaks too much or too little against his normal\\nhabits; if he abounds in obscene remarks, being, when in\\nhealth, of measured speech and decent in his discourse, and\\nif he utters words that have no consequence, if he breathes\\nmore faintly than he must, or uncovers his private parts in\\nthe presence of those who are near him. We also regard as\\nbeing in a state of delirium those whose minds are affected\\nby some derangement in the organs of sense, or who use\\nthem in a fashion not customary to them, as when, for\\nexample, a sufferer is deprived of some voluntary action or\\nacts inhabitually.”\"*\\n\\n3. Thus understood, discourse covers the entire range\\nof madness. Madness, in the classical sense, does not designate so much a specific change in the mind or in the body,\\nas the existence, under the body’s alterations, under the\\noddity of conduct and conversation, of a delirious discourse, The simplest and most general definition we can\\ngive of classical madness is indeed delirium: “This word is\\n_ derived from lira, a furrow; so that deliro actually means to\\n\\n(99)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nmove out of the furrow, away from the proper path of\\nreason.”** Hence it is not surprising to find the eighteenthcentury nosographers often classifying vertigo as a madness, and more rarely hysterical convulsions; this is because\\nit is often impossible to find in hysterical convulsions the\\nunity of a language, while vertigo affords the delirious\\naffirmation. that the world is really “turning around.” Such\\ndelirium is a necessary and sufficient reason for a disease to\\nbe called madness. .\\n\\n4. Language is the first and last structure of madness,\\nits constituent form; on language are based all the cycles in\\nwhich madness articulates its nature. That the essence of\\nmadness can be ultimately defined in the simple structure of\\na discourse does not reduce it to a purely psychological\\nnature, but gives it a hold over the totality of soul and\\nbody; such discourse is both the silent language by which\\nthe mind speaks to itself in the truth proper to it, and the\\nvisible articulation in the movements of the body, Parallelisms, complements, all the forms of immediate communication which we have seen manifested, in madness are suspended between soul and body in this single language and\\nin its powers, The movement of passion which persists until\\nit breaks and turns against itself, the sudden appearance of\\nthe image, and the agitations of the body which were its\\nvisible concomitants—all this, even as we were trying to\\nreconstruct it, was already secretly animated by this language. If the determinism of passion is transcended and\\nreleased in the hallucination of the image, if the image, in“\\nreturn, has swept away the whole world of beliefs and desires, it is because the delirious language was already present—a discourse which liberated passion from all its limits,\\nand adhered with all the constraining weight of its affirmation to the image which was liberating itself.\\n\\nIt is in this delirium, which is of both body and soul, of\\nboth language and image, of both grammar and physiol\\n(100)\\n\\x0c Passion and Delirium\\n\\nogy, that all the cycles of madness conclude and begin. It is\\nthis delirium whose rigorous meaning organized them from\\nthe start. It is madness itself, and also, beyond each of its\\nphenomena, its silent transcendence, which constitute the\\ntruth of madness.\\n\\nA last question remains: In the name of what can this\\nfundamental language be regarded as a delirium? Granting\\nthar it is the truth of madness, what makes it true madness\\nand the originating form of insanity? Why should it be in\\nthis discourse, whose forms we have seen to be so faithful\\nto the rules of reason, that we find all those signs which will\\nmost manifestly declare the very absence of reason?\\n\\nA central question, but one to which the classical age has\\nnot formulated a direct answer. We must approach it\\nobliquely, interrogating the experiences which are to be\\nfound in the immediate neighborhood of this essential language of madness: that is, the dream and the delusion.\\n\\nThe quasi-oneiric character of madness is one of the constant themes in the classical period. A theme which doubtless derives from a very old tradition, to which André du\\nLaurens, at the end of the sixteenth century, still testifies;\\nfor him melancholia and dreams have the same origin and\\nbear, in relation to truth, the same value. There are “natural dreams” which represent what, during the preceding\\nday, has passed through the senses or the understanding but\\nhappens to be modified by the specific temperament of the\\nsubject. In the same way, there is a melancholia which has a\\nmerely physical origin in the disposition of the sufferer and\\nalters, for his mind, the importance, the value, and so to\\nspeak the coloration of real events. But there is also a\\nmelancholia which permits the sufferer to predict the future,\\nto speak in an unknown language, to see beings ordinarily\\ninvisible; this melancholia originates in a supernatural intervention, the same which brings to the sleeper’s mind those\\n\\n(707)\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMADNESS & CIVILIZATION\\n\\ndreams which foresee the future, announce events to come,\\nand cause him to see “strange things.”\\n\\nBut in fact the seventeenth century preserves this tradition of the resemblance between madness and dreams only\\nto break it all the more completely and to generate new,\\nmore essential relations, Relations in which madness and\\ndreams are not only understood in their remote origin or\\nin their imminent value as signs, but are confronted as\\nphenomena, in their development, in their very nature.\\n\\nDreams and madness then appeared to be of the same\\nsubstance. Their mechanism was the same; thus Zacchias\\ncould identify in sleepwalking the movements which cause\\ndreams, but which in a waking state can also provoke\\nmadness.\\n\\nIn the first moments when one falls asleep, the vapors\\nwhich rise in the body and ascend to the head are many,\\nturbulent, and dense. They are so dark that they waken no\\nimage in the brain; they merely agitate, in their chaotic\\ndance, the nerves and the muscles. The same is true in the\\nfrenzied, in maniacs: they suffer few hallucinations, no\\nfalse beliefs, but an intense agitation which they cannot\\nmanage to control, Let us continue the evolution of sleep:\\nafter the first period of turbulence, the vapors which rise to\\nthe brain are clarified, their movement organized; this is the\\nmoment when fantastic dreams are born; one sees miracles,\\na thousand impossible things. To this stage corresponds that\\nof dementia, in which one is convinced of many things\\n“which are not in real life.” Then at last the agitation of the\\nvapors is calmed altogether; the sleeper begins to see things\\nstill more clearly; in the transparency of the henceforth limpid vapors, recollections of the day before reappear in\\naccordance with reality; such images are at most transposed, on one point or another—as occurs in melancholics,\\nwho recognize all things as they are, “in particular those\\nwho are not merely distracted.” Between the gradual de\\n(102)\\n\\x0c Passion and Delirium\\n\\nvelopments of sleep—with what they contribute at each\\nstage to the quality of the imagination—and the forms of\\nmadness, the analogy is constant, because the mechanisms\\nare the same: the sare movement of vapors and spirits, the\\nsame liberation of images, the same correspondence between the physical qualities of phenomena and the psychological or moral values of sentiments. “To emerge from the\\ninsane no differently than from the sleeping.”**\\n\\nThe important thing, in Zacchias’s analysis, is that madness is not associated with dreams in their positive phenomena, but rather to the totality formed by sleep and\\ndreams together: that is, to a complex which includes—besides the image—hallucination, memory, or prediction, the\\ngreat void of sleep, the night of the senses, and all that\\nnegativity which wrests man from the waking state and its\\napparent truths. Whereas tradition compared the delirium\\nof the madman to the vivacity of the dream images, the\\nclassical period identified delirium only with the complex\\nof the image and the night of the mind, against which background it assumed its liberty. And this complex, transposed\\nentire into the clarity of the waking state, constituted madness, This is how we must understand the definitions of\\nmadness which insistently recur throughout the classical\\nperiod. The dream, as a complex figure of image and sleep,\\n1s almost always present in that definition, Either in a nega~\\ntive fashion—the notion of the waking state then being the\\nonly one that distinguishes madmen from sleepers; or in a\\npositive fashion, delirium being defined as a modality of the\\ndream, with the waking state as the specific difference:\\n“Delirium is the dream of waking persons.”’” The ancients’ notion of the dream as a transitory form of madness\\nis inverted; it is no longer the dream which borrows its\\ndisturbing powers from alienation—showing thereby how\\nfragile or limited reason is; it is madness which takes its\\noriginal nature from the dream and reveals in this kinship\\n\\n(103)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavNeEss & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nthat it is a liberation of the image in the dark night of\\nreality.\\n\\nThe dream deceives; it leads to confusions; it is illusory.\\nBut it is not erroneous. And that is why madness is not\\nexhausted in the waking modality of the dream, and why it\\noverflows into error, It is true that in the dream, the imagination forges “impossible things and miracles,” or that it\\nassembles lifelike figures “by an irrational method”; but,\\nZacchias remarks, “there is no error in these things, and\\nconsequently nothing insane.” Madness occurs when the\\nimages, which are so close to the dream, receive the affirmation or negation that constitutes error. It is in this sense that\\nthe Encyclopédie proposed its famous definition of madness: to depart from reason “with confidence and in the\\nfirm conviction that one is following it—that, it seems to\\nme, is what is called being mad.” Error is the other element\\nalways present with the dream, in the classical definition of\\ninsanity. The madman, in the seventeenth and eighteenth\\ncentunes, is not so much the victim of an illusion, of 2\\nhallucination of his senses, or of a movement of his mind.\\nHe is not abused; he deceives himself. If it is true that on\\none hand the madman’s mind is led on by the oneiric arbitrariness of images, on the other, and at the same time, he\\nimprisons himself in the circle of an erroneous consciousness; “We call madmen,” Sauvages was to say, “those who\\nare actually deprived of reason or who persist in some notable error; it is this constant error of the soul manifest in\\nits imagination, in its judgments, and in its desires, which\\nconstitutes the characteristic of this category.”\\n\\nMadness begins where the relation of man to truth is\\ndisturbed and darkened. It is in this relation, at the same\\ntime as in the destruction of this relation, that madness assumes its general meaning and its particular forms. Dementia, Zacchias says, using the term here in the most general\\nsense of madness, “lay in this, that the intellect did not\\n\\n(104)\\n\\x0c Preface\\n\\nwhich is a monologue of reason about madness, has been\\nestablished only on the basis of such a silence,\\n\\nI have not tried to write the history of that language, but\\nrather the archaeology of that silence.\\n\\nThe Greeks had a relation to something that they called\\n‘Bow. This relation was not merely one of condemnation;\\nthe existence of Thrasymachus or of Callicles suffices to\\nprove it, even if their language has reached us already enveloped in the reassuring dialectic of Socrates. But the\\nGreek Logos bad no contrary.\\n\\nEuropean man, since the beginning of the Middle Ages,\\nhas had a relation to something he calls, indiscriminately,\\nMadness, Dementia, Insanity. Perhaps it is to this obscure\\npresence that Western reason owes something of its depth,\\nas the owpooovvy of the Socratic reasoners owes something\\nto the threat of tBos. In any case, the Reason-Madness\\nnexus constitutes for Western culture one of the dimensions of its originality; it already accompanied that culture\\nlong before Hieronymus Bosch, and will follow it long\\nafter Nietzsche and Artaud. /\\n\\nWhat, then, is this confrontation beneath the language of\\nreason? Where can an interrogation lead us which does not\\nfollow reason in its horizontal course, but seeks to retrace\\nin time that constant verticality which confronts European\\nculture with what it is not, establishes its range by its own\\nderangement? What realm do we enter which is neither the\\nhistory of knowledge, nor history itself; which is controlled by neither the teleology of truth nor the rational\\nsequence of causes, since causes have value and meaning\\nonly beyond the division? A realm, no doubt, where what\\nis in question is the limits rather than the identity of a\\nculture.\\n\\nThe classical period—from Willis to Pinel, from the\\nfrenzies of Racine’s Oreste to Sade’s Juliette and the Quinta\\n\\n(27)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nPassion and Delirium\\n\\ndistinguish true from false.” But this breakdown, if we can\\nunderstand it only as negation, has positive structures\\nwhich give it singular forms. According to the different\\nforms of access to the truth, there will be different types of\\nmadness, It is in this sense that Chrichton, for example,\\ndistinguishes in the order of vesanias, first the class deliria,\\nwhich alter that relation to the truth which takes shape in\\nperception (“general delirium of the mental faculties, in\\nwhich the diseased perceptions are taken for realities”);\\nthen the class hallucinations, which alter representation\\n(“error of the mind in which imaginary objects are taken\\nfor realities, or else real objects are falsely represented”);\\nand last, the class dementias, which without abolishing or\\naltering the faculties that afford access to truch, weaken\\nthem and diminish their powers.\\n\\nBut we can also analyze madness starting with truth itself\\nand with the forms proper to it, It is in this manner that the\\nEncyclopédie distinguishes “physical truth” from “moral\\ntruth.” “Physical truth consists in the accurate relation of\\nour sensations with physical objects”; there will be a form\\nof madness determined by the impossibility of acceding to\\nthis form of truth; a kind of madness of the physical world\\nwhich includes illusions, hallucinations, all perceptual disturbances; “it is a madness to hear choirs of angels, as certain enthusiasts do.” “Moral truth,” on the other hand,\\n“consists in the exactitude of the relations we discern either\\nbetween moral objects, or between those objects and ourselves.” There will be a form of madness consisting of the\\nloss of these relations; such is the madness of character, of\\nconduct, and of the passions. “Veritable madnesses, then,\\nare all the derangements of our mind, all the illusions of selflove, and all our passions when they are carried to the point\\nof blindness; for blindness is the distinctive characteristic of\\nmadness,”?6\\n\\nBlindness: one of the words which comes closest to the\\n\\n(205)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavNESS & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nessence of classical madness, It refers to that night of quasisleep which surrounds the images of madness, giving them,\\nin their solitude, an invisible sovereignty; but it refers also\\nto ill-founded beliefs, mistaken judgments, to that whole\\nbackground of errors inseparable from madness. The fundamental discourse of delirium, in its constitutive powers,\\nthus reveals to what extent, despite analogies of form, despite the rigor of its meaning, it was not a discourse of\\nreason. It spoke, but in the night of blindness; it was more than the loose and disordered text of a dream, since it deceived itself; but it was more than an erroneous proposition, since it was plunged into that total obscurity which is\\nthat of sleep. Delirium, as the principle of madness, is a\\nsystem of false propositions in the general syntax of the\\ndream.\\n\\nMadness is precisely at the point of contact becween the\\noneiric and the erroneous; it traverses, in its variations, the\\nsurface on which they meet, the surface which both joins\\nand separates them. With error, madness shares non-truth,\\nand arbitrariness in affirmation or negation, from the\\ndream, madness borrows the flow of images and the colorful presence of hallucinations. But while error is merely\\nnon-truth, while the dream neither affirms nor judges, madness fills the void of error with images, and links hallucina~\\ntions by affirmation of the false. In a sense, it is thus plenitude, joining to the figures of night the powers of day, to\\nthe forms of fantasy the activity of the waking mind, it\\nlinks the dark content with the forms of light. But is noc\\nsuch plenitude actually the cubnination of the void? The\\npresence of images offers no more than night-ringed hallucinations, figures inscribed at the corners of sleep, hence\\ndetached from any sensuous reality; however vivid they\\nare, however rigorously established in the body, these\\nimages are nothingness, since they represent nothing; as for\\n\\n(106)\\n\\x0c Passion and Delirium\\n\\nerroneous judgment, it judges only in appearance: affirming nothing true or real, it does not affirm at all; it is ensnared in the non-being of error.\\n\\nJoining vision and blindness, image and judgment, hallucination and language, sleep and waking, day and night,\\nmadness is ultimately nothing, for it unites in them all that\\nis negative. But the paradox of this nothing is to manifest\\nitself, to explode in signs, in words, in gestures. Inextricable\\nunity of order and disorder, of the reasonable being of\\nthings and this nothingness of madness! For madness, if it is\\nnothing, can manifest itself only by departing from itself,\\nby assuming an appearance in the order of reason and thus\\nbecoming the contrary of itself, Which illuminates the\\nparadoxes of the classical experience: madness is always ab~\\nsent, in a perpetual retreat where it is inaccessible, without\\nphenomenal or positive character; and yet it is present and\\nperfectly visible in the singular evidence of the madman.\\nMeaningless disorder as madness is, it reveals, when we examine it, only ordered classifications, rigorous mechanisms\\nin soul and body, language articulated according to a visible logic. All that madness can say of itself is merely reason, though it is itself the negation of reason. In short, @\\nrational hold over madness is always possible and necessary,\\nto the very degree that madness is non-reason.\\n\\nThere is only one word which summarizes this experience, Unreason: all that, for reason, is closest and most\\nremote, emptiest and most complete; all that presents itself\\nto reason in familiar structures—authorizing a knowledge,\\nand then a science, which seeks to be positive—and all that\\nis constantly in retreat from reason, in the inaccessible domain of nothingness.\\n\\nAnd if, now, we try to assign @ value, in and of itself,\\noutside its relations with the dream and with error, to clas\\n(107)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nsical unreason, we must understand it not as reason diseased, or as reason lost or alienated, but quite simply as\\nreason dazzled.\\n\\nDazzlement is night in broad daylight, the darkness that\\nrules at the very heart of what is excessive in light’s radiance. Dazzled reason opens its eyes upon the sun and sees\\nnothing, that is, does not see; in dazzlement, the recession\\nof objects toward the depths of night has as an immediate\\ncorrelative the suppression of vision itself; at the moment\\nwhen it sees objects disappear into the secret night of light,\\nsight sees itself in the moment of its disappearance.\\n\\nTo say that madness is dazzlement is to say that the madman sees the daylight, the same daylight as the man of\\nreason (both live in the same brightness); but seeing this\\nsame daylight, and nothing but this daylight and nothing in\\nit, he sees it as void, as night, as nothing; for him the\\nshadows are the way to perceive daylight. Which means\\nthat, seeing the night and the nothingness of the night, he\\ndoes not see at all. And believing he sees, he admits as realities the hallucinations of his imagination and all the multitudinous population of night, That is why delirium and\\ndazzlement are in a relation which constitutes the essence of\\nmadness, exactly as truth and light, in their fundamental\\nrelation, constitute classical reason.\\n\\nIn this sense, the Cartesian formula of doubt is certainly\\nthe great exorcism of madness. Descartes closes his eyes and\\nplugs up his ears the better to see the crue brightness of\\nessential daylight; thus he is secured against the dazzlement\\nof the madman who, opening his eyes, sees only night, and\\nnot seeing at all, believes he sees when he imagines. In the\\nuniform lucidity of his closed senses, Descartes has broken\\nwith all possible fascination, and if he sees, he is certain of\\nseeing that which he sees. While before the eyes of the\\nmadman, drunk on a light which is darkness, rise and multi\\n(108)\\n\\x0c Passion and Delirium\\n\\nply images incapable of criticizing themselves (since the\\nmadman sees them), but irreparably separated from being\\n(since the madman sees nothing).\\n\\nUnreason is in the same relation to reason as dazzlement\\nto the brightness of daylight itself. And this is not a metaphor. We are at the center of the great cosmology which\\nanimates all classical culture. The “cosmos” of the Renaissance, so rich in internal communications and symbolisms,\\nentirely dominated by the interacting presence of the stars,\\nhas now disappeared, without “nature” having yet assumed\\nits status of universality, without its having received man’s\\nlyrical recognition, subjecting him to the rhythm of its seasons, What the classical thinkers retain of the “world,”\\nwhat they already anticipate in “nature,” is an extremely\\nabstract law, which ‘nonetheless forms the most vivid and\\nconcrete opposition, that of day and night. This is no\\nlonger the fatal time of the planets, it is not yet the lytical\\ntime of the seasons; it is the universal but absolutely divided\\nume of brightness and darkness. A form which thought\\nentirely masters in a mathematical science—Cartesian physics is a kind of mathesis of light~but which at the same\\ntime traces the great tragic caesura in human existence: one\\nthat dominates the theatrical time of Racine and the space\\nof Georges de la Tour in the same imperious fashion. The\\ncircle of day and night is the law of che classical world: the\\nmost reduced but the most demanding of the world’s necessities, the most inevitable but the simplest of nature’s legalities,\\n\\nA law which excludes all dialectic and all reconciliation;\\nwhich establishes, consequently, both the flawless unity of\\nknowledge and the uncompromising division of tragic existence; it rules over a world without ewilight, which\\nknows no effusion, nor the attenuated cares of lyricism;\\neverything must be either waking or dream, truth or dark\\n(109)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nness, the light of being or the nothingness of shadow. Such\\na law prescribes an inevitable order, 2 serene division which\\nmakes truth possible and confirms it forever.\\n\\nAnd yet on either side of this order, two symmetrical,\\ninverse figures bear witness that there are extremities where\\nit can be transgressed, showing at the same time to what\\ndegree it is essential not to transgress it. On one side, tragedy. The rule of the theatrical day has a positive content; it\\nforces tragic duration to be poised upon the singular but\\nuniversal alternation of day and night; the whole of the\\ntragedy must be accomplished in this unity of time, for\\ntragedy is ultimately nothing but the confrontation of two\\nrealms, linked to each other by time itself, in the irreconcilable. Every day, in Racine’s theater, is overhung by 2\\nnight, which it brings, so to speak, to light: the night of ©\\nTroy and its massacres, the night of Nero’s desires, Titus’s\\nRoman night, Athalie’s night. These are the great stretches\\nof night, realms of darkness which haunt the day without\\nyielding an hour, and disappear only in the new night of\\ndeath, And these fantastic nights, in their turn, are haunted\\nby a light which forms a kind of infernal reflection of the\\nday: the burning of Troy, the torches of the Praetorians.\\nthe pale light of the dream. In classical tragedy, day and\\nnight are arranged like 2 pair of mirrors, endlessly reflect\\neach other, and afford that simple couple a sudden profundity which envelops in a single movement all of man’s\\nlife and his death. In the same fashion, in De la Tour’s\\nMadeleine au miroir, light and shadow confront each other\\ndivide and at the same time unite a face and its reflection, <\\nskull and its image, a vigil and a silence; and in the Jomage\\nSaint-Alexis, the page holding the torch reveals under the\\nshadow of the vault the man who was his master—a grave\\nand luminous boy encounters all of human misery; a chilc\\nbrings death to light.\\n\\nOn the other side, facing tragedy and its hieratic lan.\\n\\n(ri0)\\n\\x0c Passion and Delirium\\n\\nguage, is the confused murmur of madness. Here, too, the\\ngreat law of the division has been violated; shadow and\\nlight mingle in the fury of madness, as in the tragic disorder. But in another mode. In night, the tragic character\\nfound a somber truth of day; the night of Troy remained\\nAndromache’s truth, as Athalie’s night presaged the truth\\nof the already advancing day; night, paradoxically, revealed;\\nit was the profoundest day of being. The madman, conversely, finds in daylight only the inconsistency of the\\nnight’s figures; he lets the light be darkened by all the illusions of the dream; his day is only the most superficial\\nnight of appearance, It is to this degree that tragic man,\\nmore than any other, is engaged in being, is the bearer of\\nhis truth, since, like Phédre, he flings in the face of the pitless sun all the secrets of the night; while the madman is\\nentirely excluded from being. And how could he not be,\\nlending as he does the day’s illusory reflection to the night’s\\nnon-being? ,\\n\\nWe understand that the tragic hero—in contrast to the\\nbaroque character of the preceding period—can never be\\nmad; and that conversely madness cannot bear within itself\\nthose values of tragedy, which we have known since Nietzsche and Artaud. In the classical period, the man of tragedy\\nand the man of madness confront each other, without 2\\npossible dialogue, without a common language; for the\\nformer can utter only the decisive words of being, uniting\\nin a flash the truth of light and the depth of darkness; the\\nlatter endlessly drones out the indifferent murmur which\\ncancels out both the day’s chatter and the lying dark.\\n\\nMadness designates the equinox between the vanity of\\nnight’s hallucinations and the non-being of light’s judgments.\\n\\nAnd this much, which the archaeology of knowledge has\\nbeen able to teach us bit by bit, was already offered to us in\\n\\n(raz)\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\na simple tragic fulguration, in the last words of Andromaque.\\n\\nAs if, at che moment when madness was vanishing from\\nthe tragic act, at the moment when tragic man was to separate himself for over two centuries from the man of unTeason~-as if, at this very moment, an ultimate figuration\\nwere demanded of madness. The curtain which falls on the\\nlast scene of Andromaque also falls on the last of the great\\ntragic incarnations of madness. But in this presence on the\\nthreshold of its own disappearance, in this madness incarcerating itself for good, is articulated what it is and will be\\nfor the entire classical age. Is it not precisely at the moment\\nof its disappearance that it can best present its truth, its\\ntruth of absence, its trath which is that of day at the limits\\nof night? This had to be the Jast scene of the first great\\nclassical tragedy; or if one prefers, the first time in which\\nthe classical truth of madness is expressed in a tragic movement which is the /ast of the preclassical theater. A truth, in\\nany case, that.is instantaneous, since its appearance can only\\nbe its disappearance; the lightning-flash is seen only in the\\nalready advancing night.\\n\\nOrestes, in his frenzy, passes through a triple circle of\\nnight: three concentric figurations of dazzlement. Day has\\njust dawned over Pyrrhus’s palace; night is still there, edging this light with shadow, and peremptorily indicating it:\\nLimit. On this morning which is a festival morning, the\\ncrime has been committed, and Pyrrhus has closed his eyes\\non the dawning day: a fragment of shadow cast here on\\nthe steps of the alrar, on the threshold of brightness and of\\ndarkness. The rwo great cosmic themes of madness are thus\\npresent in various forms, as omen, decor, and counterpoint\\nof Orestes’ frenzy.’ It can then begin: in a pitiless clarity\\nwhich denounces the murder of Pyrrhus and the treachery\\nof Hermione, in that dawn where everything finally ex.\\nplodes in a truth so old and at the same time so young, «\\n\\n(212)\\n\\x0c  \\n\\n \\n\\nPassion and Delirium\\n\\nfirst circle of shadow: a dark cloud into which, all around\\nOrestes, the world begins to withdraw, the truth appears in\\nthis paradoxical twilight, in this matinal night where the\\ncruelty of truth will be transformed into the fury of hallucination:\\n\\nMais quelle épaisse nuit, tout a coup, m’environne?\\n\\n(But what thick night suddenly surrounds me?)\\n\\nTrt is the empty night of error; but against the background of this first obscurity, a brilliance, a false light will\\nappear: that of images. The nightmare rises, not in the\\nbright light of morning, but in a somber scintillation: the\\nlight of storm and of murder.\\n\\nDieux! quels ruisseaux de sang coulent autour de moi!\\n(O Gods! What streams of blood flow around me!)\\n\\nAnd then appears the dynasty of the dream. In this night\\nthe hallucinations are set free; the Erinnyes appear and take\\nover. What makes them precarious also makes them sovereign; they triumph easily in the solitude where they succeed one another; nothing challenges them; images and language intersect, in apostrophes which are invocations,\\npresences affirmed and repulsed, solicited and feared. But\\nall these ‘images converge toward night, toward a second\\nnight which is that of punishment, of eternal vengeance, of\\ndeath within death. The Erinnyes are recalled to that darkness which is their own—their birthplace and their truth,\\nie. their own nothingness,\\n\\nVenez-vous mienlever dans Péternelle nuit?\\n(Do you come to bear me off into eternal night?)\\n\\nThis is the moment when it is revealed that the images of\\nmadness are only dream and error, and if the sufferer who\\nis blinded by them appeals to them, it is only to disappear\\nwith them in the annihilation to which they are fated.\\n\\nA second time, then, we pass through a circle of night.\\nBut we are not thereby restored to the daylight reality of\\n\\n(223)\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nthe world. We accede, beyond what is manifested in madness, to delirium, to that essential and constitutive structure\\nwhich had secretly sustained madness from the first. This\\ndelirium has a name, Hermione; Hermione who no longer\\nreappears as a hallucinatory vision, but as the ultimate truth\\nof madness. It is significant that Hermione intervenes at this\\nvery moment of the frenzy: not among the Eumenides, nor\\nahead of them—to guide them; but behind and separated\\nfrom them by the night into which they have dragged\\nOrestes and in which they themselves are now scattered.\\nHermione intervenes as a figure of delirium, as the truth\\nwhich secretly reigned from the start, and of which the\\nEumenides were ultimately only the servants. Here we\\nare at the opposite of Greek tragedy, where the Erinnyes\\nwere the final destiny and truth which, in the night of time,\\nhad awaited the hero; his passion was merely their instrument. Here the Eumenides are merely figures in the service\\nof delirium, the primary and ultimate truth, which was already appearing in passion, and now declares itself in its\\nnakedness. This truth rules alone, thrusting images away:\\nMais non, retirez-vous, laissez faire Hermione.\\n(But no, begone, Jet Hermione do her work.)\\n\\nHermione, who has always been present from the beginning, Hermione who has always lacerated Orestes, destroying his reason bit by bit, Hermione for whom he has\\nbecome “parricide, assassin, sacrilége,” reveals herself finally as the truth and culmination of his madness. And\\ndelirium, in its rigor, no longer has anything to say except\\nto articulate as imminent decision a truth long since commonplace and laughable:\\n\\nEt je lui porte enfin mon coeur a dévorer.\\n(And I bring her at last my heart to devour.)\\n\\nDays and years ago Orestes had offered up this savage\\n\\nsacrifice. But now he expresses this principle of his madness\\n\\n(224)\\n\\x0c  \\n\\nPREFACE\\n\\ndel Sordo of Goya—covers precisely that epoch in which\\nthe exchange between madness and reason modifies its language, and in a radical manner. In the history of madness,\\ntwo events indicate this change with a singular clarity:\\n1657, the creation of the Hépital Général and the “great\\nconfinement” of the poor; 1794, the liberation of the\\nchained inmates of Bicétre. Between these two unique and\\nsymmetrical events, something happens whose ambiguity\\nbas left the historians of medicine at a loss: blind repression\\nin an absolutist regime, according to some; but according to\\nothers, the gradual discovery by science and philanthropy\\nof madness in its positive truth. As a matter of fact, beneath\\nthese reversible meanings, a structure is forming which\\ndoes not resolve the ambiguity but determines it, It is this\\nstructure which accounts for the transition from the medieval and humanist experience of madness to our own experience, which confines insanity within mental illness. In\\nthe Middle Ages and until the Renaissance, man’s dispute\\nwith madness was a dramatic debate in which be confronted the secret powers of the world; the experience of\\nmadness was clouded by images of the Fall and the Will of\\nGod, of the Beast and the Metamorphosis, and of all the\\nmarvelous secrets of Knowledge. In our era, the experience\\nof madness remains silent in the composure of a knowledge\\nwhich, knowing too much about madness, forgets it. But\\nfrom one of these experiences to the other, the shift bas\\nbeen made by a world without images, without positive\\ncharacter, in a kind of silent transparency which reveals—\\nas mute institution, act without commentary, immediate\\nknowledge—a great motionless structure; this structure is\\none of neither drama nor knowledge; it is the point where\\nhistory is immobilized in the tragic category which both\\nestablishes and impugns it.\\n\\n(sii)\\n\\x0c Passion and Delirium\\n\\nas an end. For madness cannot go any farther. Having uttered its truth in its essential delirium, it can do no more\\nthan collapse in a third night, that night from which there\\nis no return, the night of an incessant devouring. Unreason\\ncan appear only for a moment, the instant when language\\nenters silence, when delirium itself is stilled, when the heart\\nis at last devoured.\\n\\nIn the tragedies of the early seventeenth century, madness, too, released drama; but it did so by liberating truth;\\nmadness still had access to language, to a renewed language\\nof explanation and of reality reconquered, It could be at\\nmost only the penultimate moment of the tragedy. Not the\\nlast, as in Andromaque, in which no truth is uttered except\\nthe truth, in delirium, of a passion which has found with\\nmadness the perfection of its fulfillmenc.\\n\\nThe movement proper to unreason, which classical learning followed and pursued, had already accomplished the\\nwhole of its trajectory in the concision of tragic language.\\nAfter which, silence could reign, and madness disappear in\\nthe—always withdrawn—presence of unreason.\\n\\nWhat we now know of unreason affords us a better understanding of what confinement was.\\n\\nThis gesture, which banished madness to a neutral and\\nuniform world of exclusion, did not mark a halt in the\\nevolution of medical techniques, nor in the progress of\\nhumanitarian ideas. It assumed its precise meaning in this\\nfact: that madness in the classical period ceased to be the\\nsign of another world, and that it became the paradoxical\\nmanifestation of non-being. Ultimately, confinement did\\nseek to suppress madness, to eliminate from the social order\\na figure which did not find its place within it; the essence of\\nconfinement was not the exorcism of a danger. Confinement merely manifested what madness, in its essence, was:\\na manifestation of non-being; and by providing this man\\n(tis)\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavness & CIVELIZATION\\n\\nifestation, confinement thereby suppressed it, since it restored it to its truth as nothingness, Confinement is the\\npractice which corresponds most exactly to madness experienced as unreason, that is, as the empty negativity of\\nreason; by confinement, madness is acknowledged to be\\nnothing. ‘That is, on one hand madness is immediately perceived as difference: whence the forms of spontaneous and\\ncollective judgment sought, not from physicians, but from\\nmen of good sense, to determine the confinement of a madman, and on the other hand, confinement cannot have any\\nother goal than a correction (that is, the suppression of the\\ndifference, or the fulfillment of this nothingness in death);\\nwhence those options for death so often to be found in the\\nregisters of confinement, written by the attendants, and\\nwhich are not the sign of confinement’s savagery, its inhumanity or perversion, but the strict expression of its\\nmeaning: an operation to annihilate nothingness.” Confinement sketches, on the surface of phenomena and in a\\nhasty moral synthesis, the secret and distinct structure of\\nmadness,\\n\\nThen did confinement establish its practices in this\\nprofound intuition? Was it because madness under the\\neffect of confinement had really vanished from the classical\\nhorizon that it was ultimately stigmatized as non-being?\\nQuestions whose answers refer to each other in a perfect\\ncircularity. It is futile, no doubt, to lose oneself in the endless cycle of these forms of interrogation. Better to let classical culture formulate, in its general structure, the experience it had of madness, an experience which crops up with\\nthe same meanings, in the identical order of its inner logic,\\nin both the order of speculation and the order of institutions, in both discourse and decree, in both word and\\nwatchword—wherever, in fact, a signifying element can\\nassume for us the value of a language.\\n\\nC216)\\n\\x0c V\\noes\\nCae\\n\\nuy\\n\\nASPECTS OF ACADNESS\\n\\nIn this chapter we do not wish to write a history of the\\ndifferent notions of psychiatry in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but rather to show the specific faces by\\nwhich madness was recognized in classical thought. Faces\\nstill haunted by mythical figures, but which have often\\nbeen essential in the organization of our practical knowl\\nedge.\\n1. Mania and Melancholia\\n\\nThe notion of melancholia was fixed, in the sixteenth century, between a certain definition by symptoms and an\\nexplanatory principle concealed in the very term that designated it. Among the symptoms, we find all the delirious\\nideas an individual can form about himself: “Some think\\nthemselves to be beasts, whose voice and actions they imitate. Some think that they are vessels of glass, and for this\\nreason recoil from passers-by, lest they break; others fear\\n\\n(717)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c MADNESS & CIVILIZATION\\n\\ndeath, which they yet cause most often to themselves. Still\\nothers imagine that they are guilty of some crime, so that\\nthey tremble with terror when they see another coming\\ntoward them, thinking he seeks to take them prisoner and\\nsentence them to death.”! Delirious themes that remain isolated and do not compromise reason’s totality. Thomas\\nSydenham would even observe that melancholics “are\\npeople who, apart from their complaint, are prudent and\\nsensible, and who have an extraordinary penetration and\\nsagacity, Thus Aristotle rightly observed that melancholics\\nhave more intelligence than other men.”\\n\\nNow this clear and coherent syndrome was designated\\nby a word that implied an entire causal system, that of\\nmelancholia: “I beg you to regard closely the thoughts of\\nmelancholics, their words, visions, actions, and you will discover how all their senses are depraved by a melancholic\\nhumor spread through their brain.”? Partial delirium and\\nthe action of black bile were juxtaposed in the notion of\\nmelancholia, unrelated for the moment beyond 2 disjunct\\nconfrontation of a group of signs by a signifying name. Yet\\nin the eighteenth century a unity would be found, or rather\\nan exchange would be made—the nature of that cold, black\\nhumor having become the major coloration of delirium, its\\npositive value in contrast to mania, dementia, and frenzy,\\nits essential principle of cohesion. And while Hermann\\nBoerhaave still defined melancholia as merely “‘a long, persistent delirium without fever, during which the sufferer is\\nobsessed by only one thought,” Dufour, several years later,\\nshifted the weight of his definition to “fear and sadness,”\\nwhich were now supposed to explain the partial character\\nof the delirium: “Hence it is that melancholics love solitude\\nand shun company; this makes them more attached to the\\nobject of their delirium or to their dominant passion, what~\\never it may be, while they seem indifferent to anything\\nelse.” The concept is fixed not by a new rigor in observa\\n(778)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Aspects of Madness\\n\\ntion, nor by a discovery in the realm of causes, but by a\\nqualitative transmission proceeding from a cause implied in\\nthe designation to a significant perception in the effects.\\n\\nFor a long time—until the beginning of the seventeenth\\ncentury--the discussion of melancholia remained fixed\\nwithin the tradition of the four humors and their essential\\nqualities: stable qualities actually inherent in a substance,\\nwhich alone could be considered as their cause. For Jean\\nFernel, the melancholic humor, related to earth and to autamn, is a juice “thick in consistency, cold and dry in temperament.” But in the first half of the century, a debate\\nbegan over the origin of melancholia: must one necessarily\\nhave a melancholic temperament to be afflicted with melancholia? Is the melancholic humor always cold and dry—is\\nit never warm, or humid? Is it the substance which acts, or\\nthe qualities which are transmitted? The results of this\\nlong debate may be summarized as follows:\\n\\n1. The causality of substances is increasingly replaced\\nby a movement of qualities, which, without any vehicular\\nmeans, are immediately transmitted from body to soul,\\nfrom humor to ideas, from organs to conduct. Thus, for\\nDuncan’s Apologist the best proof that the melancholic\\njuice produces melancholia is that in it one finds the very\\nqualities of the disease: “The melancholic juice possesses to\\na far greater degree the conditions necessary to produce\\nmelancholia than your fiery angers; since by its coldness, it\\ndiminishes the quantity of spirits; by its dryness, it renders\\nthem capable of preserving for a long time the type of a\\nstrong and persistent imagination; and by its blackness, it\\ndeprives them of their natural clarity and subtlety.””*\\n\\n2. There is, besides this mechanics of qualities, a dynamics that analyzes the strength to be found imprisoned in\\neach. Thus cold and dryness can enter into conflict with\\nthe temperament, and this opposition will generate symptoms of melancholia violent in proportion to the struggle:\\n\\n(zig)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavness & CivILizaTION\\n\\nthe strength that prevails and sweeps away all chat resists it.\\nThus women, whose nature is little inclined to melancholy,\\nfall a prey to it all the more seriously: “They are cruelly\\nused and violently disturbed by it, for melancholia being\\nmore opposed to their temperament, it removes them further from their natural constitution.”*\\n\\n3. But it is sometimes within the quality itself that the\\nconflict is generated. A quality may alter in the course of\\nits development and become the opposite of what it was.\\nThus when “the entrails are heated, when all simmers\\nwithin the body .. . and ali the juices are consumed,”\\nthen this conflagration can turn to cold melancholia—producing “almost the same thing caused by the flow of wax in\\na torch marned upside down. . . . This cooling of the\\nbody is the ordinary effect which follows immoderate heat\\nonce it has thrown off and exhausted its vigor.”* There is a\\nkind of dialectic of qualities which, free from any constraint of substance, from any predetermination, makes its\\nway through reversals and contradictions.\\n\\n4. Finally, qualities may be altered by accidents, circumstances, the conditions of life; so that a being who is dry\\nand cold can become warm and humid, if his way of life\\ninclines him to it; as in the case of women: they “remain in\\nidleness, their bodies tend to perspire less [chan those of\\nmen], and heat, spirits, and humors remain wichin.”*\\n\\nThus freed from a confining substantial basis, qualities\\nwould be able to play an organizing and integrating role in\\nthe notion of melancholia. On the one hand, they would\\ntrace, among the symptoms and manifestations, a certain\\nprofile of sadness, of blackness, of slowness, of immobility.\\nOn the other, they would suggest a causal basis which\\nwould no longer be the physiology of a humor, but the\\npathology of an idea, of a fear, of a terror. The morbid\\nentity was not defized from observed signs nor from supposed causes; but somewhere between, and beyond both, it\\n\\n(220)\\n\\x0c Aspects of Madness\\n\\nwas perceived as a certain qualitative coherence, which had\\nits own laws of transmission, of development, and of transformation. It is the secret logic of this quality that controls\\nthe development of the idea of melancholia, not medical\\ntheory. This is evident as early as Thomas Willis’s texts.\\n\\nAt first glance, the coherence of their analyses is\\nvouched for on the level of speculative reflection. Willis’s\\nexplanation is borrowed whole from animal spirits and cheir\\nmechanical properties. Melancholia is “‘a madness without\\nfever or frenzy, accompanied by fear and sadness.” To the\\nextent that it is delirium—that is, an essential break with\\ntruth—its origin resides in a disordered movement of the\\nspirits and in a defective state of the brain; but can that\\nfear, that anxiety which makes melancholics “sad and punctilious,” be explained by movements alone? Might there be\\na mechanism of fear and a circulation of spirits that is peculiar to sadness? This is obvious to Descartes; it is no longer\\nso for Willis. Melancholia cannot be treated like a paralysis,\\nan apoplexy, a vertigo, or 2 convulsion. In fact, it cannot\\neven be analyzed as a simple dementia, although melancholic delirium supposes a similar disorder in the movement\\nof spirits; disturbances in the mechanism easily explain delirium—that error common to all madness, dementia or\\nmelancholia—but not the quality peculiar to delirium, the\\ncoloration of sadness and fear which makes its landscape so\\nunique. One must penetrate the secret of predispositions.\\nAfter all, it is these essential qualities, hidden in the very\\ngrain of the subtle matter, that explain the paradoxical\\nmovements of the spirits.\\n\\nIn melancholia, the spirits are swept by an agitation, but\\na feeble agitation, without power or violence: a sort of\\nimpotent jostling which does not follow marked paths, nor\\nopen roads (aperta opercula), but traverses the cerebral\\nmatter by endlessly creating new pores; yet the spirits do\\nnot wander far upon the paths they trace; very soon their\\n\\n(i271)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Mavwness & CivILIZATION\\n\\nagitation languishes, their strength fails, and the movement\\nstops: “they do not reach far.”7 Thus such disturbance,\\ncommon to all delirium, can produce on the surface of the\\nbody neither those violent movements nor those cries that\\nmay be observed in mania and frenzy; melancholia never\\nreaches violence; it is madness at the limits of its powerlessness, This paradox is the result of the secret alterations of\\nthe spirits. Usually they have the quasi-immediate rapidity\\nand the absolute transparence of luminous rays; but in melancholia, they. are charged with darkness; they become\\n“obscure, opaque, shadowy”; and the images of things\\nwhich they bear to the brain and to the mind are veiled\\nwith “shadow and with shades.” They become heavy and\\ncloser to a dark chemical vapor than to pure light. A chemical vapor that would be of an acid nature, rather than\\nsulfurous or alcoholic: for in acid vapors the particles are\\nmobile, and even incapable of rest, but their activity is\\nweak, without effect; when they are distilled, nothing remains in the alembic but an insipid phlegm. Do not acid\\nvapors have the very properties of melancholia, whereas\\nalcoholic vapors, always ready to burst into flame, suggest\\nfrenzy; and sulfurous vapors, agitated by a violent and continuous movement, indicate mania? If, then, one were to\\nseek “the formal reason and the causes” of melancholia, one\\nwould consider the vapors that rise from the blood to the\\nbrain and that have degenerated into an acid and corrosive\\nvapor. In appearance, it is a melancholia of the spirits, a\\nchemistry of the humors that oriented Willis’s analysis; but\\nin fact, the principal clue is afforded by the immediate qualities of melancholic suffering: an impotent disorder, and\\nthen that shadow over the mind, along with that acid bicterness which corrodes thought and feeling alike. The\\nchemistry of acids is not the explanation of the symptoms;\\nit is a qualitative option: a phenomenology of melancholic\\nexperience.\\n\\n(122)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nAspects of Madness\\n\\nSome seventy years later, animal spirits lost their scientific prestige. Now it was from the body’s liquid and solid\\nelements that the secret of disease was sought. The Medical\\nDictionary which Robert James published in England in\\n1743 proposes, under Mania, a comparative etiology of that\\ndisease and of melancholia: “It is evident that the brain is\\nthe seat . . . of all diseases of this nature. . . . It is there\\nthat the Creator has fixed, although in a manner which is\\ninconceivable, the lodging of the soul, the mind, genius,\\nimagination, memory, and all sensations. . . . All these\\nnoble functions will be changed, depraved, diminished, and\\ntotally destroyed, if the blood and the humors corrupted in\\nquality and quantity are no longer carried to the brain in a\\nuniform and temperate manner, but instead circulate there\\nwith violence and impetuosity, or move about slowly, with\\ndifficulty or with langnor.” It is this languishing flow, these\\nchoked vessels, this heavy, clogged blood that the heart\\nlabors to distribute throughout the organism, and which\\nhas difficulty penetrating into the very fine arterioles of the\\nbrain, where the circulation ought to be very rapid in order\\nto maintain the movement of thought—ic is al] this distressing obstruction which explains melancholia. Heaviness, encumbrance—here again the primitive qualities guide analysis. The explanation becomes a transfer to the organism of\\nqualities perceived in the condition, the conduct, the words\\nof the sick person. We move from qualitative apprehension\\nto supposed explanation. But it is this apprehension that\\ncontinues to prevail and always wins out over theoretical\\ncoherence. Anne-Charles Lorry juxtaposes the two main\\nforms of medical explanation—by solids and by fluids—and\\nultimately causes them to intersect, thus distinguishing two\\nkinds of melancholia, The one whose origin is in solids is\\nnervous melancholia: a particularly strong sensation agitates the fibers which receive it; as a result, tension increases\\nin the other fibers, which become more rigid and at the\\n\\n(123)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c MADNESS & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nsame time susceptible to further vibration. But should the\\nsensation become even stronger, then the tension increases\\nto such a degree in the other fibers that they become incapable of vibrating; the state of rigidity is such that the\\nflow of blood is stopped and the animal spirits immobilized.\\nMelancholia has set in. In the other form of disease, the\\n“fiquid form,” the humors are impregnated with black bile,\\nthey become thicker; clogged with these humors, the blood\\nthickens and stagnates in the meninges until it compresses\\nthe principal organs of the nervous system. Then we find\\nagain the rigidity of the fibers, but in this case it is no more\\nthan a consequence of a humoral phenomenon. Lorry distinguishes two melancholias: actually it is the same group\\nof qualities, affording melancholia its real unity, that he\\nemploys successively in two explanatory systems. Only the\\ntheoretical edifice has been doubled. The qualitative basis\\nin experience remains the same.\\n\\nA symbolic unity formed by the languor of the fluids, by\\nthe darkening of the animal spirits and the shadowy twilight they spread over the images of things, by the viscosity\\nof the blood that laboriously trickles through the vessels,\\nby the thickening of vapors that have become blackish,\\ndeleterious, and acrid, by visceral functions that have become slow and somehow slimy—this unity, more a product\\nof sensibility than of thought or theory, gives melancholia\\nits characteristic stamp.\\n\\nTt is this undertaking, more than faithful observation,\\nwhich reorganizes melancholia’s symptoms and mode of\\nappearance. The theme of a partial delirium increasingly\\ndisappears as a major symptom of melancholics in favor of\\nqualitative data like sadness, bitterness, a preference for\\nsolitude, immobility. At the end of the eighteenth century,\\nall forms of madness without delirium, but characterized\\nby inertia, by despair, by a sort of dull stupor, would be\\nreadily classified as melancholia.* And as early as James’s\\n\\n(124)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c CONTENTS\\n\\n“Stultifera Navis”\\n\\nThe Great Confinement\\nThe Insane\\n\\nPassion and Delirium\\nAspects of Madness\\nDoctors and Patients\\nThe Great Fear\\n\\nThe New Division\\n\\nThe Birth of the Asylum\\nConclusion\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n38\\n65\\n85\\n117\\n159\\n\\n199\\n221\\n\\n241\\n279\\n291\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nAspects of Madness\\n\\nDictionary, an apoplectic melancholia is discussed, in which\\nthe sufferers “refuse to rise from their beds . . . ; once on\\ntheir feet, they will not walk unless they are forced by\\ntheir friends or attendants; they in no way avoid others,\\nbut they seem to pay no attention to what is said to them;\\nthey make no answer.” If, in this case, immobility and silence prevail and determine the diagnosis of melancholia,\\nthere are cases in which one observes only bitterness, languor, and a preference for isolation; their very agitation\\nmust not deceive the observer nor authorize a hasty diagnosis of mania; these patients are definitely suffering from\\nmelancholia, for “they avoid company, prefer solitary\\nplaces, and wander without knowing where they are going;\\nthey have a yellowish color, a dry tongue as in a person\\nsuffering from great thirst, and their eyes are dry, hollow,\\nnever moistened with tears; their entire body is dry and\\nburning hot, their face dark, and expressing only horror\\nand sadness.””*\\n\\nThe analyses of mania and their evolution during the\\nclassical period obey the same principles of coherence,\\n\\nWillis opposes mania to melancholia. The mind of the\\nmelancholic is entirely occupied by reflection, so that his\\nimagination remains at leisure and in repose; the maniac’s\\nimagination, on the contrary, is occupied by a perpetual\\nflux of impetuous thoughts. While the melancholic’s mind\\nis fixed on a single object, imposing unreasonable proportions upon it, but upon it alone, mania deforms all concepts\\nand ideas; either they lose their congruence, or their representative value is falsified; in any case, the totality of\\nthought is disturbed in its essential relation to truth. Melancholia, finally, is always accompanied by sadness and fear;\\non the contrary, in the maniac we find audacity and fury.\\nWhether it is a question of mania or melancholia, the cause\\nof the disease is always in the movement of the animal\\n\\n(125)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nspirits. But this movement is quite particular in mania: it is\\ncontinuous, violent, always capable of piercing new pores\\nin the cerebral matter, and it creates, as the material basis of\\nincoherent thoughts, explosive gestures, continuous words\\nwhich betray mania. Is not such pernicious mobility that of\\nan infernal water, sulfurous liquid, those aquae stygiae, ex\\nnitro, vitriolo, antimonio, arsenico, et similibus exstillatae:\\nits particles are in perpetual movement; they are capable of\\nprovoking new pores and new channels in any substance;\\nand they have strength enough to spread themselves far,\\nexactly as the maniacal spirits are capable of spreading agitation through all the parts of the body. An infernal water\\ngathers in the secrecy of its movements all the images in\\nwhich mania takes its concrete form. It constitutes, in an\\nindissociable way, both its chemical myth and its dynamic\\ntruth,\\n\\nIn the course of the eighteenth century, the image, with\\nall its mechanical and metaphysical implications, of animal\\nspirits in the channels of the nerves, was frequently replaced by the image, more strictly physical but of an even\\nmore symbolic value, of a tension to which nerves, vessels,\\nand the entire system of organic fibers were subject. Mania\\nwas thus a tension of the fibers carried to its paroxysm, the\\nmaniac a sort of instrument whose strings, by the effect of\\nan exaggerated traction, began to vibrate at the remotest\\nand faintest stimulus. Maniacal delirium consisted of a continual vibration of the sensibility. Through this image, the\\ndifferences from melancholia became precise and were organized into a rigorous antithesis: the melancholic can no\\nlonger enter into 2 resonance with the external world, because his fibers are relaxed or because they have been immobilized by too great a tension (we see how the mechanics of tension explains melancholic immobility as well as\\nmaniacal agitation): only a few fibers vibrate in the melancholic, those which correspond to the precise point of his\\n\\n(726)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Aspects of Madness\\n\\ndelirium. On the contrary, the maniac vibrates to any and\\nevery stimulus; his delirium is universal; stimuli do not\\nvanish into the density of his immobility, as in the melancholic’s case; when his organism returns them, they have\\nbeen multiplied, as if the maniac had accumulated a supplementary energy in the tension of his fibers, It is this very\\nfact, moreover, that makes the maniac, in his turn, insensible, not with the somnolent insensibilicy of the melancholic, but with an insensibiliry taut with interior vibrations; this is doubtless why maniacs “fear neither heat nor\\ncold, tear off their clothes, sleep naked in the dead of winter without feeling the cold.” It is also why they substitute\\nfor the real world, which nonetheless continues to solicit\\nthem, the unreal and chimerical world of their delirium:\\n“The essential symptoms of mania result from the fact that\\nobjects do not present themselves to the sufferers as they\\nare in reality.”*° The delirium of maniacs is not determined by 2 particular error of judgment; it constitutes a\\ndefect in the transmission of sense impressions to the brain,\\na flaw in communication. In the psychology of. madness,\\nthe old idea of truth as “the conformity of thought to\\nthings” is transposed in the metaphor of a resonance, a kind\\nof musical fidelity of the fibers to the sensations which\\nmake them vibrate.\\n\\nThis theme of manic tension develops, beyond a medicine of solids, into intuitions that are still more qualitative.\\nThe rigidity of fibers in a maniac always belongs to a dry\\nlandscape; mania is regularly accompanied by 2 wasting of\\nthe humors, and by 2 general aridity in the entire organism.\\nThe essence of mania is desertic, sandy. Théophile Bonet,\\nin his Sepulchretum anatomicum, declares that the brains of\\nmaniacs, insofar as he had been able to observe them, al‘ways seemed to be in a state of dryness, of hardness, and of\\nfriabiliry. Later, Albrecht von Haller also found that the\\nmaniac’s brain was hard, dry, and brittle. Menuret repeats\\n\\n(127)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c    \\n\\n \\n   \\n\\nMAvNESS & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nan observation of Forestier’s that clearly shows how an\\nexcessive loss of a humor, by drying out the vessels and\\nfibers, may provoke a state of mania; this was the case of a\\nyoung man who “having married his wife in the summertime, became maniacal as a result of the excessive intercourse he had with her.”\\n\\nWhat some imagined or supposed, what others saw in a\\nquasi-perception, Dufour proved, numbered, named. During an autopsy, he removed part of the medullary substance from the brain of a subject who had died in a state of\\nmania; he cut out “a cube six lines in each direction” the\\nweight of which was 3 j.g. III, while the same volume taken\\nfrom an ordinary brain weighed 3 j.g. V: “this inequality\\nin weight, which seems at first of little consequence, is no\\nlonger so slight if we consider the fact that the specific\\ndifference between the total mass of the brain of a madman\\nand that of a normal man is around 7 gros less in the adult,\\nin whom the brain’s entire mass ordinarily weighs three\\nlivres.” Mania’s dessication and lightness show even on the\\nscale,\\n\\nWere not this internal dryness and this heat further\\nproved by the ease with which maniacs endured great\\ncold? It was an established fact that they had been seen\\nwalking naked in the snow, that there was no need to warm\\nthem when they were confined in the asylum, that they\\ncould even be cured by cold. Since Jean-Baptiste van Helmont, the immersion of maniacs in ice water had been\\nwidely practiced, and Menuret states that he knew a maniac who, having escaped from the prison where he was\\nkept, “walked several leagues in a violent rain without a hat\\nand almost without clothing, and who by this means recovered perfect health.” Montchau, who cured a maniac by\\n“pouring ice water upon him, from as high above as possible,” was not astonished by so favorable a result, to explain it he united all the themes of organic calefaction that\\n\\n(128)\\n\\x0c Aspects of Madness\\n\\nhad succeeded and intersected each other since the seventeenth century: “One need not be surprised that ice water\\nproduces such a prompt and perfect cure precisely when\\nboiling blood, furious bile, and mutinous liquors carried\\ndisturbance and irritation everywhere”; by the impression\\nof coldness, “the vessels contracted more violently and\\nfreed themselves of the liquors that crammed them, the\\nirritation of the solid parts caused by the extreme heat of\\nthe liquors they contained ceased, and when the nerves\\nrelaxed, the course of the spirits that had proceeded irregularly from one side to the other was re-established in its\\nnatural state.”\\n\\nThe world of melancholia was humid, heavy, and cold;\\nthat of mania was parched, dry, compounded of violence\\nand fragility; a world which heat—unfelt but everywhere\\nmanifested—made arid, friable, and always ready to relax\\nunder the effect of a moist coolness. In the development of\\nall these qualitative simplifications, mania attained both its\\nfull scope and its unity. It has doubtless remained what it\\nwas at the beginning of the seventeenth century, “fury\\nwithout fever,” but beyond these two characteristics,\\nwhich were still only descriptive, there developed a perceptual theme which was the real organizer of the clinical picture. Once the explanatory myths disappeared, and humors, spirits, solids, fluids no longer had any currency,\\nthere would remain only the schema of coherent qualities\\nwhich would no longer even be named, and what this dynamics of heat and movement slowly formed into a constellation characteristic of mania would now be observed as a\\nnatural complex, as an immediate truth of psychological\\nobservation. What had been perceived as heat, imagined as\\nagitation of spirits, conceived as fibrous tension, would\\nhenceforth be recognized in the neutralized transparency\\nof psychological notions: exaggerated vivacity of internal\\nimpressions, rapidity in the association of ideas, inattention\\n\\n(129)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Mavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nto the external world. De Ja Rive’s description already has\\nthis limpidity: “External objects do not produce upon the\\nmind of a sufferer the same impression as upon the mind of\\na healthy man; these impressions are weak, and the sufferer\\nrarely heeds them; his mind is almost entirely absorbed by\\nthe action of the ideas produced by the deranged state of\\nhis brain. These ideas have such a degree of vivacity that\\nthe sufferer believes they represent real objects, and judges\\naccordingly.” But we must not forget that this psychological structure of mania, as it appeared and was stabilized at\\nthe end of the eighteenth century, is only the superficial\\nsketch of an entire profound organization, which itself\\nwould capsize and which had developed according to the\\nhalf-perceptual, half-iconographic laws of a qualitative\\nworld,\\n\\nNo doubt this entire universe of heat and cold, of humidity and dryness, reminded medical thought, about to accede\\nto positivism, of the circumstances of its own origin. But\\nthis blazon of images was not simply reminiscence; it was\\nalso an undertaking. In order to form the practical experience of mania or melancholia, this gravitation, against 2\\nbackground of images, of qualities attracted to each other\\nby a whole system of sensuous and affective affinities was\\nessential. If mania, if melancholia henceforth assumed the\\naspects our science knows them by, it is not because in the\\ncourse of centuries we have learned to “open our eyes” to\\nreal symptoms; it is not because we have purified our perception to the point of transparency; it is because in the\\nexperience of madness, these concepts were organized\\naround certain qualitative themes that lent them their\\nunity, gave them their significant coherence, made them\\nfinally perceptible. We have passed from a simple notional\\ndescription (fury without fever, delirious idée fixe) to a\\nqualitative realm, apparently less organized, simpler, less\\nprecisely limited, but which alone was able to. constitute\\n\\n(230)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Aspects of Madness\\n\\nrecognizable, palpable units really present in the total experience of madness. The field of observation of these diseases was partitioned into landscapes that obscurely gave\\nthem their style and their structure. On the one hand, a\\nsodden, almost diluvian world, where man remained deaf,\\nblind, and numb to all that was not his one terror: a world\\nsimplified in the extreme, and immoderately enlarged in 2\\nsingle one of its details. On the other, a parched and\\ndesertic world, a panic world where all was flight, disorder, instantaneous gesture. It was the rigor of these\\nthemes in their cosmic form—not the approximations of an\\nobserving caution—which organized the experience (already almost our own experience) of mania and melancholia.\\n\\nIe is Willis, with his spirit of observation, the purity of\\nhis medical perception, whom we honor as the “discoverer”\\nof the mania-melancholia alternation. Certainly Willis’s\\nmethods are of great interest, chiefly in this particular: the\\ntransition from one affection to the other is seen not as 2\\nphenomenon of observation for which it was then a matter\\nof discovering the explanation, but rather as the consequence of a profound natural affinity which was of the\\norder of their secret nature. Willis does not cite a single\\ncase of alternation which he had occasion to observe; what\\nhe first discovered was an internal relation which engendered strange metamorphoses: “After melancholia, we\\nmust consider mania, with which it has so many affinities\\nthat these complaints often change into one another”: it\\nhappens, in fact, chat the melancholic predisposition, if aggravated, becomes frenzy; frenzy, on the contrary, when it\\ndecreases and loses its force, finally grows calm and turns\\nto melancholic diathesis. A rigorous empiricism would see\\ntwo related diseases here, or even two successive symptoms\\nof the same disease. However, Willis does not pose the\\n\\n(231)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Mavwness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nproblem in terms of symptoms nor in terms of disease; he\\nmerely seeks the link connecting two states in the dynamics\\nof animal spirits. In the melancholic, we remember, the spirits were somber and dim; they cast their shadows over the\\nimages of things and formed a kind of dark tide; in the\\nmaniac, on the contrary, the spirits seethed in a perpetual\\nferment; they were carried by an irregular movement, constantly repeated; 2 movement that eroded and consumed,\\nand even without fever, sent out its heat. Between mania\\nand melancholia, the affinity is evident: not the affinity of\\nsymptoms linked in experience, but the affinity—more\\npowerful and so much more evident in the landscapes of\\nthe imagination—that unites in the same fire both smoke\\nand flame. “If we can say that in melancholia, the brain and\\nthe animal spirits are obscured by smoke and a dense vapor,\\nmania seems to ignite a kind of conflagration hitherto\\nmuffled by them.” The flame in its rapid movement dissipates the smoke; but the smoke, when it fails back, smothers the flame and extinguishes its brightness. The combination of mania and melancholy is not, for Willis, 2 disease; it\\nis a secret fire in which flame and smoke are in conflict; it is\\nthe vehicle of that light and that shadow.\\n\\nVirtually all of the physicians of the eighteenth century\\nacknowledged the proximity of mania and melancholia.\\nSeveral, however, refused to call them two manifestations\\nof the same disease. Many observed a succession without\\nperceiving a symptomatic unity. Sydenham prefers to divide the domain of mania itself: on one hand, ordinary\\nmania—due to “an overexcited and too rapid blood”; on\\nthe other, a mania which, as a general rule, “degenerates\\ninto stupidity.” The latter “results from the weakness of\\nthe blood which too long a fermentation has deprived of its\\nmost spirituous parts.” Even more often, it is acknowledged that the succession of mania and melancholia is a\\n\\n(732)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Aspects of Madness\\n\\nphenomenon either of metamorphosis or of remote causality. For Joseph Lieutaud, a melancholia that lasts a long\\ntime and whose delirium is exacerbated loses its traditional\\nsymptoms and assumes a strange resemblance to mania:\\n“the last stage of melancholia has many affinities with\\nmania.” But the status of this analogy is not elaborated. For\\nDufour, the tink is even looser: it is a remote causal connection, melancholia being able to provoke mania, as well as\\n“Svorms in the frontal sinuses, or dilated or varicose vessels.” Without the support of an image, no observation succeeded in transforming the evidence of succession into a\\nsymptomatic structure that was both precise and essential.\\n\\nOf course the image of flame and smoke disappeared in\\nWillis’s successors; but it was still by images that the work\\nof organization was accomplished—images increasingly\\nfunctional, more firmly fixed in the great physiological\\nthemes of circulation and heating, increasingly remote\\nfrom the cosmic figures Willis had borrowed them from.\\nFor Boerhaave and his commentator Gerard van Swieten,\\nmania formed quite naturally the highest degree of melancholia—not only following a frequent metamorphosis, but\\nas the result of a necessary dynamic sequence: the cerebral\\nLiquid, which stagnates in the melancholic, becomes agitated after a certain time, for the black bile that fills the\\nviscera becomes by its very immobility “bitterer and more\\nmalignant”; there then form in it more acid and subtler\\nelements which, carried to the brain by the blood, provoke\\nthe maniac’s great agitation. Mania is thus distinguished\\nfrom melancholia only by a difference of degree: it is its\\nnatural consequence, it results from the same causes, and is\\nordinarily treated by the same remedies. For Friedrich\\nHoffmann, the unity of mania and melancholia is a natural\\neffect of the laws of movement and shock; but what is pure\\nmechanics on the level of principles becomes dialectics in\\n\\n(733)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMADNESS & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nthe development of life and of disease. Melancholia, in\\neffect, is characterized by immobility; in other words, the\\nthickened blood congests the brain where it accumulates;\\nwhere ir ought to circulate, it tends to stop, immobilized by\\nits heaviness. But if this heaviness retards movement, it also\\nmakes the shock more violent at the moment it occurs; the\\nbrain, the vessels by which it is traversed, its very substance, more violently jarred, tend to resist more, therefore\\nto harden, and by this hardening the thickened blood is\\nsent back more energetically; its movement increases and it\\nis soon caught up in that agitation which is mania. We have\\nthus passed quite naturally from the image of an immobile\\ncongestion to images of dryness, of hardness, of rapid\\nmovement, and this by a sequence in which the principles\\nof classical mechanics are at every moment influenced, deflected, distorted by a fidelity to iconographic themes\\nwhich are the true organizers of this functional unity.\\nSubsequently other images will be added, but will no\\nlonger play a constitutive role; they will function only as\\nso many interpretive variations upon the theme of a previously acquired unity. Witness for example the explanation\\nSpengler proposed for the alternation between mania and\\nmelancholia, borrowing its principle from the electric battery. First there is a concentration of nervous power and of\\nits fluid in a certain region of the system; only this sector is\\nagitated, all the rest is in a state of sleep: this is the melancholic phase. But. when it reaches a certain degree of intensity, this local charge suddenly expands into the entire system, which ir agitates violently for a certain time, until its\\ndischarge is complete: this is the manic episode. At this\\nlevel of elaboration, the image is too complex and too complete, it is borrowed from a model too remote to have an\\norganizing role in the perception of a pathological unity. It\\nis, on the contrary, suggested by that perception, which\\n\\n(234)\\n\\x0c \\x0c Aspects of Madness\\n\\nitself is based on unifying, though much more elementary,\\nimages.\\n\\nIt is these images which are secretly present in the text of\\nJames\\'s Dictionary, one of the first in which the manicdepressive cycle is given as an observed phenomenon, as 2\\nunity easily perceived by an unprejudiced scrutiny. “It is\\nabsolutely necessary to reduce melancholia and mania to 2\\nsingle species of disease, and consequently to consider them\\nin one and the same glance, for we find from our experiments and our day-to-day observations that one and the\\nother have the same origin and the same cause. . . . The\\nmost exact observations and our daily experience confirm\\nthe fact, for we see that melancholics, especially those in\\nwhom the disposition is inveterate, easily become maniacal,\\nand when the mania ceases, the melancholia begins again, in\\nsuch a way that there is a passage and return from one to\\nthe other after certain periods of time.”\"! What was constituted, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, under\\nthe influence of images, was therefore a perceptual structure, and not a conceptual system or even a group of symptoms, The proof of this is that, just as in a perception,\\nqualitative transitions could occur without affecting the\\nintegrity of the figure. Thus William Cullen would discover in mania, as in melancholia, “a principal object of\\ndelirium”—and, inversely, would attribute melancholia to\\n“a drier and firmer tissue of the brain’s medullary substance.”\\n\\nThe essential thing is that the enterprise did not proceed\\nfrom observation to the construction of explanatory images; thar on the contrary, the images assured the initial\\nrole of synthesis, that their organizing force made possible a\\nstructure of perception, in which at last the symptoms\\ncould attain their significant value and be organized as the\\nvisible presence of the truth.\\n\\n(735)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nIl. Hysteria and Hypochondria\\n\\n‘Two problems arise where these are concerned.\\n\\n1. To what degree is it legitimate to treat them as mental\\ndiseases, or at least as forms of madness?\\n\\n2, Are we entitled to treat them together, as if they constituted a virtual couple, similar to that formed quite early\\nby mania and melancholia?\\n\\nA glance at the classifications is enough to convince us;\\nhypochondria does not always appear beside dementia and\\nmania; hysteria is very rarely found there. Felix Plater\\nmentioned neither one among the lesions of the senses; and\\nat the end of the classical period, Cullen still catalogued\\nthem in another category than that of the vesanias: hypochondria among the “adynamias, or diseases which consist\\nof a weakness or a loss of movement in the vital or animal\\nfunctions”; hysteria among “the spasmodic affections of\\nthe natural functions.”\\n\\nMoreover, in nosographic charts one rarely finds these\\ntwo diseases grouped in a logical proximity, or even combined in the form of an opposition, Sauvages classifies\\nhypochondria among the _hallucinations—“hallucinations\\nthat concern only the health”—hysteria among the forms\\nof convulsion. Linnaeus employs the same distinctions. Are\\nthey not both faithful to the teaching of Willis, who had\\nstudied hysteria in his book De morbis convulsivis and\\nhypochondria in the section of De anima brutorum which\\ndealt with diseases of the head, giving it the name of passio\\ncolica? Here it is certainly a question of rwo quite different\\ndiseases; in one case, the overheated spirits are subject to a\\nreciprocal pressure which may give the impression that\\nthey are exploding—provoking those irregular or preternatural movements whose insane aspect constitutes hysterical convulsions. On the contrary, in passio colica, the spir\\n(136)\\n\\x0c  \\n\\nAspects of Madness\\n\\nits are irritated because of a matter that is hostile and\\ninappropriate to them (infesta et improportionnata); they\\nthen provoke disturbances, irritations, corrugationes in the\\nsensitive fibers. Willis therefore advises us not to be surprised by certain analogies of symptoms: certainly, we\\nhave seen convulsions produce pains as if the violent movement of hysteria could provoke the sufferings of hypochondria. But the resemblances are deceptive. “The\\nsubstance is not the same, but a little different.”\\n\\nBut beneath these fixed distinctions of the nosographers,\\na slow labor was being performed which tended increasingly to identify hysteria and hypochondria, as two forms\\nof one and the same disease. In 1725 Richard Blackmore\\npublished a Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours, or Hypochondriacal and Hysterical Affections; in it the two illnesses were defined as two varieties of a single affection—\\neither a “morbific constitution of the spirits” or a “disposition to leave their reservoirs and to consume themselves.”\\nFor Whytt, in the middle of the eighteenth century, the\\nidentification was complete; the system of symptoms is\\nhenceforth identical: “An extraordinary sensation of cold\\nand heat, of pains in several parts of the body; syncopes\\nand vaporous convulsions; catalepsy and tetanus; gas in the\\nstomach and intestines; an insatiable appetite for food;\\nvomiting of black matter; a sudden and abundant flow of\\nclear, pale urine; marasma or nervous atrophy; nervous\\ncough; palpitations of the heart; variations in the pulse;\\nperiodic headaches; vertigo and dizzy spells; diminution\\nand failure of eyesight; depression, despair, melancholia or\\neven madness; nightmares or incubi.”\\n\\nMoreover, during the classical period hysteria and hypochondria slowly joined the domain of mental diseases,\\nRichard Mead could still write apropos of hypochondria:\\n“Tr is an illness of the whole body.” And we must restore its\\ntrue value to Willis’s text on hysteria: “Among the diseases\\n\\n(2:37)\\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMapness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nof women, hysterical affection is of such bad repute that\\nlike the semi-dammnati it must bear the faults of numerous\\nother affections; if a disease of unknown nature and hidden\\norigin appears in a woman in such a manner that its cause\\nescapes us, and that the therapeutic course is uncertain, we\\nimmediately blame the bad influence of the uterus, which,\\nfor the most part, is not responsible; and when we are dealing with an inhabitual symptom, we declare that there is 2\\ntrace of hysteria hidden beneath it all, and what has so\\noften been the subterfuge of so much ignorance we take as\\nthe object of our treatment and our remedies.” With all\\ndue regard to the traditional commentators on this text,\\nwhich is inevitably cited in any study on hysteria, it does\\nnot mean that Willis suspected the absence of an organic\\nbasis in symptoms of hysterical affection. He merely says,\\nand in an explicit way, that the idea of hysteria is a catchall\\nfor the fantasies, not of the person who is or believes himself ill, but of the ignorant doctor who pretends to know\\nwhy, Nor does the fact that hysteria is classified by Willis\\namong diseases of the head indicate that he considered it a\\ndisorder of the mind; but only that he attributed its origin\\nto a change in the nature, the origin, and the initial course\\nof the animal spirits.\\n\\nHowever, at the end of the eighteenth century, hypochondria and hysteria figured, almost without dispute, on\\nthe escutcheon of mental disease. In 1755 Alberti published\\nat Halle his dissertation De morbis imaginariis hypochondriacorum; and Lieutaud, while defining hypochondria by\\nits spasms, recognized that “the mind is affected as much as\\nand perhaps more than the body, hence the term hypochondriac has become almost an offensive name avoided by\\nphysicians who would please.” As for hysteria, Joseph Raulin no longer ascribes to it any organic reality, at least in his\\nbasic definition, establishing it from the start in a pathology\\nof the imagination: ‘This disease in which women invent,\\n\\n(738)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\n \\n\\nAspects of Madness\\n\\nexaggerate, and repeat all the various absurdities of which a\\ndisordered imagination is capable, has sometimes become\\nepidemic and contagious.”\\n\\nThere were thus two essential lines of development, during the classical period, for hysteria and hypochondria.\\nOne united them to form a common concept which was\\nthat of a “disease of the nerves”; the other shifted their\\nmeaning and their traditional pathological basis—sufficiently indicated by their names—and tended to integrate\\nthem gradually into the domain of diseases of the mind,\\nbeside mania and melancholia. But this integration was not\\nachieved, as in the case of mania and melancholia, on the\\nlevel of primitive qualities, perceived and imagined in their\\niconographic values. We are dealing here with an entirely\\ndifferent type of integration.\\n\\nThe physicians of the classical period certainly tried to\\ndiscover the qualities peculiar to hysteria and hypochondria, But they never reached the point of perceiving that\\nparticular coherence, that qualitative cohesion which gave\\nmania and melancholia their unique contour. All qualities\\nwere contradictorily invoked, each annulling the others,\\nleaving untouched the problem of what was the ultimate\\nnature of these two diseases.\\n\\nOften hysteria was perceived as the effect of an internal\\nheat that spread throughout the entire body, an effervescence, an ebullition ceaselessly manifested in convulsions\\nand spasms, Was this heat not related to the amorous ardor\\n\\nwith which hysteria was so often linked, in girls looking for\\nhusbands and in young widows who had lost theirs? Hysteria was ardent, by nature; its symptoms referred more\\neasily to an image than to an illness, that image was drawn\\nby Jacques Ferrand, at the beginning of the seventeenth\\ncentury, in all its material precision. In his Maladie @’amour\\nou mélancholie érotique, he declared that women were\\n\\n(739)\\n\\x0c   \\n\\n    \\n\\nMaovNEsSsS & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nmore often distracted by love than men; but with what art\\nthey could dissimulate it! “In which their mien is similar to\\nalembics featly resting upon cylinders, without one’s being\\nable to see the fire from without, yet if one looks beneath\\nthe alembic, and places one’s hand upon a woman\\'s heart,\\none will find in both places a fiery furnace.” An admirable\\nimage, in its symbolic weight, its affective overtones, and\\nthe referential play of its imagery. Long after Ferrand, one\\nfinds the qualifying theme of humid heat used to characterize the secret distillations of hysteria and of hypochondria;\\nbur the image yielded to a more abstract motif. Already in\\nNicolas Chesneau, the flame of the feminine alembic had\\ngrown quite colorless: “I say that the hysterical affection is\\nnot 2 simple one, but that we understand by this name\\nseveral diseases caused by a malign vapor which arises in\\nsome way or other, is corrupted, and undergoes an extraordinary effervescence.” For others, on the contrary,\\nthe heat rising from the hypochondriac regions is completely dry: hypochondriacal melancholia is a “hot, dry”\\nillness, caused by “humors of the like quality.” But some\\nperceived no heat in either hysteria or hypochondria: the\\nquality peculiar to these maladies was on the contrary languor, inertia, and a cold humidity like that of the stagnant\\nhumors: “I think that these affections [hypochondriacal\\nand hysterical], when they last for some time, come from\\nthe fibers of the brain and the nerves when they are slack\\nand therefore feeble, without action or elasticity; as a consequence of which the nervous fluid is impoverished and\\nwithout force.”? There is probably no text that bears better witness to the qualitative instabilicy of hysteria than\\nGeorge Cheyne’s book The English Malady: according to\\nCheyne, the disease maintains its unity only in an abstract\\nmanner; its symptoms are dispersed into different qualitative regions and attributed to mechanisms that belong to\\neach of these regions in its own right. All symptoms of\\n\\n(740)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Aspects of Madness\\n\\nspasm, cramp, and convulsion derive from a pathology of\\nheat symbolized by “harmful, bitter, or acrimonious vapors.” On the contrary, all psychological or organic signs\\nof weakness—‘“depression, syncopes, inactivity of the\\nmind, lethargic torpor, melancholia, and sadness” —manifest a condition of fibers which have become too humid or\\ntoo weak, doubtless under the effect of cold, viscous, thick\\nhumors that obstruct the glands and the vessels, serous and\\nsanguine alike. As for paralyses, they signify both a chilling\\nand an immobilization of the fibers, “‘an interruption of\\nvibrations,” frozen so to speak in the general inertia of\\nsolids,\\n\\nTt was as difficult for the phenomena of hysteria and\\nhypochondria to find a place within the compass of qualities as it was easy for mania and melancholia to be established there.\\n\\nThe medicine of movement was just as indecisive in\\ndealing with them, its analyses just as unstable. It was quite\\nclear, at least to any perception that did not reject its own\\nimages, that mania was related to an excessive mobility;\\nmelancholia, on the contrary, to a diminution of movement. For hysteria and for hypochondria as well, the\\nchoice was a difficult one. Georg Ernst Stahl opts instead\\nfor an increasing heaviness of the blood, which becomes so\\nabundant and so thick that it is no longer capable of circulating regularly through the portal vein; it has a tendency\\nto stagnate, to collect there, and the crisis is a result “of the\\neffort it makes to effect an issue either by the higher or the\\nlower parts.” For Boerhaave, on the contrary, and for Van.\\nSwieten, hysterical movement is due to an excessive mobility of all the fluids, which become so volatile, so inconsistent, that they are agitated by the least movement: “In\\nweak constitutions,” Van Swieten explains, “the blood is\\ndissolved; it barely coagulates, the serum is thus without\\nconsistency, without quality; the lymph resembles the se\\n(247)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Mavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nram, as do the other fluids which the latter provides. .\\n\\nIn this way, it becomes probable that the so-called immaterial hysterical affection and hypochondriacal disease derive\\nfrom the dispositions of the particular state of the fibers.” Ic\\nis to this sensibility, this mobility, that we must attribute\\nthe sufferings, the spasms, the singular pains so readily\\nsuffered by “young girls of pale complexion, and individuals too much given to study and nieditation.” Hysteria is\\nindiscriminately mobile or immobile, fluid or dense, given\\nto unstable vibrations or clogged by stagnant humors. No\\none has managed to discover the actual nature of its movements.\\n\\nWe receive the same impression in the realm of chemical\\nanalogies: for Lange, hysteria is a product of fermentation,\\nquite precisely of the fermentation “of salts, sent into\\ndifferent parts of the body,” with “the humors that are\\nlocated there.” For others, it is of an alkaline nature. Michael Ettmiller, on the contrary, considers that diseases of\\nthis kind belong to a chain of acid reactions, “the immediate cause being the acid rawness of the stomach; the chyle\\nbeing acid, the quality of the blood is corrupted; it no\\nlonger furnishes spirits; the lymph is acid, the bile without\\nstrength; the nervous system suffers irritation, the digestive\\nleaven, spoiled, is less volatile and too acid.” Viridet undertakes to reconstitute, apropos of “vapors which we experience,” a dialectic of alkalis and acids whose movements and\\nviolent collisions, in the brain and the nerves, provoke the\\nsigns of hysteria and hypochondria. Certain particularly\\nvolatile animal spirits are alkaline salts that move with great\\nspeed and transform themselves into vapors when they become too tenuous; but there are other vapors that are volatilized acids; the ether gives these latter enough movement\\nto carry them to the brain and the nerves where, “encountering the alkalis, they cause infinite ills.”\\n\\nStrange, the qualitative instability of these hysterical and\\n\\n(142)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAspects of Madness\\n\\nhypochondriacal illnesses; strange, the confusion of their\\ndynamic properties and the secret nature of their chemistry! To the very degree that the diagnosis of mania and\\nmelancholia seemed simple in the context of qualities, so the\\ndecipherment of these illnesses seemed hesitant. No doubt,\\nthis imaginary landscape of qualities which was decisive for\\nthe constitution of the melancholia-mania couple remained\\nsecondary in the history of hysteria and hypochondria,\\nwhere it probably played no more than the role of continually shifted scenery. The progress of hysteria did not lead,\\nas did that of mania, through the world’s obscure qualities\\nreflected in a medical imagery. The space in which it assomed its dimensions was of another kind: that of the\\nbody, in the coherence of its organic values and its moral\\nvalues.\\n\\nIc is customary to credit Charles le Pois and Willis with\\nliberating hysteria from the old myths of uterine displacement. Jean Li¢bault, translating or rather adapting Marinello’s book to seventeenth-century standards, still accepted, despite some restrictions, the idea of a spontaneous\\nmovement of the womb; if it shifted position “it was to be\\nmore at ease; not that this was done out of prudence, behest, or animal stimulus, but to preserve health and to experience the enjoyment of something delectable.” No\\ndoubt, it was no longer deemed possible for the womb to\\nchange place or to course through the body somersaulting\\nas it went, for it was “strictly attached” by its neck, by\\nligaments, by vessels, and finally by the tunic of the peritoneum; yet it could change position: “And so the womb,\\nthough it be so strictly attached to the parts we have described that it may not change place, yet often changes\\nposition, and makes curious and so to speak perulant movements in the woman’s body. These movements are various:\\nto wit, ascending, descending, convulsive, vagrant, pro\\n(243)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMADNESS & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nlapsed. The womb rises to the liver, spleen, diaphragm,\\nstomach, breast, heart, lung, gullet, and head.” The physicians of the classical period were almost unanimous in\\nrefusing to accept such an explanation.\\n\\nAt the beginning of the seventeenth century, Le Pois\\ncould write, speaking of hysterical convulsions: “Of all\\nthese one source is the father, and this not through sympathy but through idiopathy.” More precisely, their origin\\nis in an accumulation of fluids toward the posterior part of\\nthe skull: “Just as a river results from the confluence of a\\nquantity of smaller vessels which join to form it, so the\\nsinuses that are on the surface of the brain and terminate in\\nthe posterior part of the head amass the liquid because of\\nthe head’s inclined position. The heat of the parts then\\ncauses the liquid to warm and affect the origin of the\\nnerves.” Willis, in his tum, makes 2 minute critique of the\\nuterine explanation: it is especially from affections of the\\nbrain and the nervous system “that all the derangements\\nand irregularities which obtain in the movement of the\\nblood during this illness derive.” And yet all these analyses\\ndid not thereby abolish the idea of an essential link between\\nhysteria and the womb. But the link is differently conceived: it is no longer regarded as the trajectory of a real\\ndisplacement through the body, but as a sort of secret propagation through the pathways of the organism and through\\nfunctional proximities. We cannot say that the seat of the\\ndisease had become the brain, nor that Willis had made\\npossible a psychological analysis of hysteria. But the brain\\nnow played the part of a relay station and the distributor of\\na disease whose origin was visceral: the womb occasioned it\\nalong with all the other viscera. Until the end of the eighteenth century, until Pinel, the uterus and the womb remained present in the pathology of hysteria, but as the\\nresult of a privileged diffusion by the humors and nerves,\\nand not by a special prestige of their nature.\\n\\n(744)\\n\\x0c MADNESS\\nAND\\nCIVILIZATION\\n\\nA History of Insanity in the\\nAge of Reason\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Aspects of Madness\\n\\nStahl justifies the parallelism of hysteria and hypochondria by a curious comparison of menstrual flow and hemorthoids. He explains, in his analysis of spasmodic movements, that the hysterical affection is a violent pain, “accompanied by tension and compression, which makes itself\\nprincipally felt below the hypochondriac regions.” It is\\ncalled a hypochondriacal disease when it attacks men “in\\nwhom nature makes an effort to be rid of excess blood by\\nvomiting or hemorrhoids”; it is called a hysterical affection\\n* when it attacks women “the course of whose periods is not\\nas it should be. However, there is no essential difference\\nbetween these two affections.” Hoffman\\'s opinion is quite\\nsimilar, in spite of many theoretical differences. The cause\\nof hysteria is in the womb—loosening and weakening—but |\\nthe seat of the disease is to be sought, ‘as in the case of\\nhypochondria, in the stomach and the intestines; the blood\\nand the vital humors begin to stagnate “in the membranous\\nand nervous tunics of the intestines”; gastric disturbances\\nresult, which spread thence throughout the whole body. At\\nthe very center of the organism, the stomach serves as a\\nrelay station and diffuses the maladies that come from the\\ninterior and subterranean cavities of the body: “It is not to\\nbe doubted that the spasmodic affections experienced by\\nhypochondriacs and hysterics have their seat in the nervous\\nparts, and especially in the membranes of the stomach and\\nthe intestines, from which they are communicated by the\\nintercostal nerve to the head, to the chest, to the kidneys,\\nto the liver, and to all the principal organs of the body.”\\n\\nThe role Hoffmann assigns to the intestines, the stomach,\\nand the intercostal nerve is indicative of the manner in\\nwhich the problem was presented in the classical period. It\\n‘was not so much a question of escaping the old localization\\nin the uterus, but of discovering the principle and the pathways of a diverse, polymorphous disease dispersed\\nthroughout the entire body. A disease was to be accounted\\n\\n(145)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Mavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nfor that could attack the head as well as the legs, express\\nitself in a paralysis or in frenzied movements, that could\\nbring on catalepsy or insomnia: in short, a disease that\\ntraversed corporeal space so rapidly and so ingeniously that\\nit was virtually present throughout the entire body.\\n\\nIt is futile to insist on the change of medical horizons that\\noccurred from Marinello to Hoffmann. Nothing subsists of\\nthat famous mobility ascribed to the uterus, which had\\nconstantly figured in the Hippocratic tradition. Nothing,\\nexcept perhaps 2 certain theme which appeared more\\nclearly now that it was no longer confined to 2 single medical theory, but persisted unchanged through the succession\\nof speculative concepts and explanatory schemas. This was\\nthe theme of a dynamic upheaval of corporeal space, of a\\ntide of the lower powers, which, too long constrained and,\\nas it were, congested, began to seethe and ultimately spread\\ntheir disorder—with or without the brain’s mediation—\\nthrough the entire body. This theme remained almost stationary until the beginning of the eighteenth century, despite the complete reorganization of physiological concepts. And strangely enough, it was during the. eighteenth\\ncentury, when no theoretical or experimental innovation in\\npathology had occurred, that the theme was suddenly modified, changed direction—that a dynamics of corporeal\\nspace was replaced by a morality of sensibility. It was then,\\nand only then, that the ideas of hysteria and hypochondria\\n‘were to veer, and definitively enter the world of madness,\\n\\nWe must try now to reconstitute the evolution of the\\ntheme, in each of its three stages:\\n\\n1. a dynamics of organic and moral penetration;\\n\\n2. a physiology of corporeal continuity;\\n\\n3an ethic of nervous sensibility.\\n\\nIf corporeal space is perceived as a solid and continuous\\nwhole, the disordered movement of hysteria and of hypo\\n(246)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nAspects of Madness\\n\\nchondria could result only from an element whose extreme\\ntenuousness and incessant mobility permitted it to penetrate\\ninto the place occupied by the solids themselves. As Nathaniel Highmore put it, the animal spirits, “because of\\ntheir igneous tenuity, can penetrate even the densest, the\\nmost compact bodies . . . , and because of their activity,\\ncan penetrate the entire microcosm in a single instant.” The\\nspirits, if their mobility increased, if penetration occurred,\\nchaotically and in an untimely manner, in all the parts of\\nthe body to which they were unsuited, provoked a thousand diverse signs of disturbance. Hysteria, for Highmore\\nas for Willis, his adversary, and for Sydenham as well, was\\nthe disease of 2 body indiscriminately penetrable to all the\\nefforts of the spirits, so that the internal order of organs\\ngave way to the incoherent space of masses passively subject to the chaotic movement of the spirits, These latter\\n“move impetuously and in excessive quantity upon such or\\nsuch a part, there causing spasms or even pain . . . and\\ndisturbing the function of the organs, both those which\\nthey abandon and those toward which they move, neither\\nbeing able to avoid serious damage from this unequal distribution of spirits, which is entirely contrary to the laws\\nof animal economy.”* The hysterical body was thus given\\nover to that disorder of the spirits which, outside of all\\norganic laws and any functional necessity, could successively seize upon all the available spaces of the body.\\n\\nThe effects varied according to the regions affected, and\\nthe disease, undifferentiated in the pure source of its movement, assumed various configurations depending on the\\nspaces it traversed and the surfaces where it appeared:\\n“Having accumulated in the stomach, they rush in a host\\nand with impetuosity upon the muscles of the larynx and\\nthe pharynx, producing spasms throughout the entire area\\nthey traverse, and causing in the stomach a swelling which\\nresembles a large ball.” A little higher, the hysterical affec\\n(147)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\ntion, “seizing upon the colon and upon the region which is\\nbelow the heart cavity, causes there an insupportable pain\\nwhich resembles the iliac affection.” Should it rise still\\nhigher, the disease attacks “the vital parts and causes so\\nviolent a palpitation of the heart that the sick person does\\nnot doubt that his attendants must be able to hear the\\nsound his heart makes as it beats against his ribs,” Finally, if\\nit attacks “the exterior part of the head, between the\\ncranium and the pericranium, and there remains fixed in a\\nsingle spot, it causes an extreme pain that is accompanied\\nby violent fits of vomiting.”\"* Each part of the body determines in its own right and by its own nature the form of\\nthe symptom produced. Hysteria thus appears as the most\\nreal and the most deceptive of diseases; real because it is\\nbased upon a movement of the animal spirits; illusory as\\nwell, because it generates symptoms that seem provoked by\\na disorder inherent in the organs, whereas they are only the\\nformation, at the level of these organs, of a central or\\nrather general disorder; it is the derangement of internal\\nmobility that assumes the appearance, on the body’s surface, of a local symptom. Actually suffering from the disordered and excessive movement of spirits, the organ imitates its own illness; starting from a defect in the movement\\nwithin internal space, it imitates a disorder that strictly belongs to itself; in this manner, hysteria “imitates almost all\\nthe maladies to which human flesh is subject, for in what.\\never part of the body it lodges, it immediately produces the\\nsymptoms that are proper to that part, and if the physician\\ndoes not have great wisdom and experience, he will easily\\nbe deceived and will attribute to an illness essential and\\nproper to such and such a part, symptoms that are entirely\\nthe result of hysterical affection”:’® stratagems of a disease\\nthat, traversing corporeal space in the homogenous form of\\nmovement, manifests itself in specific aspects; but the type,\\nhere, is not essence; it is a ruse of the body.\\n\\n(748)\\n\\x0c Aspects of Madness\\n\\nThe more easily penetrable the internal space becomes,\\nthe more frequent is hysteria and the more various its aspects; but if the body is firm and resistant, if internal space\\nis dense, organized, and solidly heterogeneous in its different regions, the symptoms of hysteria are rare and its\\neffects will remain simple. Is this not exactly what separates\\nfemale hysteria from the male variety, or, if you will, hysteria from hypochondria? Neither symptoms, in fact, nor\\neven causes form the principle of separation between the\\ndiseases, but only the spatial solidarity of the body, and so\\nto speak the density of the interior landscape: “Beyond\\nwhat we may call the exterior man, who is composed of\\nparts which are visible to the senses, there is an interior man\\nformed of a system of animal spirits, a man who can be seen\\nonly with the eyes of the mind. This latter man, closely\\n_ joined and so to speak united with the corporeal constitution, is more or less deranged from his state to the degree\\nthat the principles which form the machine have a natural\\nfirmness, That is why this disease attacks women more than\\nmen, because they have a more delicate, less firm constitution, because they lead a softer life, and because they are\\naccustomed to the luxuries and commodities of life and not\\nto suffering.” And already, in the lines of this text, this\\nspatial density yields one of its meanings: it is also a moral\\ndensity; the resistance of the organs to the disordered penetration of the spirits is perhaps one and the same thing as\\nthat strength of soul which keeps the thoughts and the\\ndesires in order. This internal space which has become\\npermeable and porous is perhaps only the laxity of the\\nheart. Which explains why so few women are hysterical\\nwhen they are accustomed to a hard and laborious life, yet\\nstrongly incline to become so when they lead a soft, idle,\\nluxurious, and Jax existence; or if some sorrow manages to\\nconquer their resolution: “When women consult me about\\nsome complaint whose nature I cannot determine, I ask if\\n\\n(149)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Mavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nthe malady from which they are suffering attacks them\\nonly when they have some sorrow . . . : if they admit as\\nmuch, I am fully assured that their complaint is an hysterical affection.”*\\n\\nThus we have a new formulation of the old moral intuition that from the time of Hippocrates and Plato had made\\nthe womb a living and perpetually mobile animal, and distributed the spatial ordering of its movements; this intuition\\nperceived in hysteria the incoercible agitation of desires in\\nthose who had neither the possibility of satisfying them nor\\nthe strength to master them; the image of the female organ\\nrising to the breast and to the head gave a mythical expression to an upheaval in the great Platonic tripartition and in\\nthe hierarchy that was intended to assure its immobility.\\nFor Sydenham, for the disciples of Descartes, the moral\\nintuition is identical; but the spatial landscape in which it is\\nexpressed has changed; Plato\\'s vertical and hieratic order is\\nreplaced by 2 volume which is traversed by incessant motion whose disorder is no longer a revolution of the depths\\nto the heights but a lawless whirlwind in a chaotic space.\\nThis “interior body” which Sydenham tried to penetrate\\nwith “the eyes of the mind” was not the objective body\\navailable to the dull gaze of a neutralized observation; it\\nwas the site where a certain manner of imagining the body\\nand of deciphering its internal movements combined with a\\ncertain manner of investing it with moral values. The\\ndevelopment is completed, the work done on the level of\\nthis ethical perception. In this perception the ever pliant\\nimages of medical theory are inflected and altered; in it,\\ntoo, the great moral themes are formulated and gradually\\nalter their initial aspect.\\n\\nThis penetrable body must, however, be a continuous\\nbody. The dispersion of the disease through the organs is\\nonly the reverse of 2 movement of propagation which per\\n(150)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Aspects of Madness\\n\\nmits it to pass from one to another and to affect them all in\\nsuccession. If the body of the hypochondriac or the hysteric is a porous body, separated from itself, distended by\\nthe invasion of disease, this invasion can be effected only by\\nmeans of a certain spatial continuity. The body in which\\nthe disease circulates must have other properties than the\\nbody in which the sufferer’s dispersed symptoms appear.\\n\\nThe problem haunted eighteenth-century medicine, and\\nwas to make hypochondria and hysteria diseases of the\\n“nervous type”; that is, idiopathic diseases of the general\\nagency of all the sympathies.\\n\\nThe nervous fiber is endowed with remarkable’ properties, which permit it to integrate the most heterogeneous\\nelements. Is it not astonishing that, responsible for transmitting the most diverse impressions, the nerves should be\\nof the same nature everywhere, and in every organ? “The\\nnerve whose expansion at the back of the eye makes it\\npossible to receive the impression of so subtle a matter as\\nlight; the nerve which, in the organ of hearing, becomes\\nsensitive to the vibrations of sonorous bodies, differs no\\nwhit in nature from those which serve the grosser sensa~\\ntions such as touch, taste, and odor.” This identity of nature, in different functions, assures the possibility of communication between the most distant organs, and those\\nmost dissimilar physiologically: “This homogeneity in che\\nnerves of the animal, combined with the numerous communications that all maintain with each other . . . establishes among the organs a harmony that often makes one or\\nseveral parts participate in the affections of those which\\nare injured.”*” But what is still more admirable, a nervous\\nfiber can transmit simultaneously the stimulus of a voluntary movement and the impression left on the organ by the\\nsenses. Simon-André Tissot conceived this double function\\nof one and the same fiber as the combination of an undulatory movement for voluntary stimulus (“this is the move\\n(rsr)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Mapness & CiVILIZATION\\n\\nment of a fluid enclosed in a malleable container, in a\\nbladder, for example, that when I press it would eject\\nliquid through a tube”) and a corpuscular movement for\\nsensation (“this is the movement of a succession of ivory\\nballs”). Thus sensation and movement can be produced at\\nthe same time in the same nerve: any tension and any relaxation in the fiber will alter both movements and sensations, as we can observe in all nervous diseases.\\n\\nAnd yet, despite all these unifying virtues of the nervous\\nsystem, is it certain that we can explain, by the real network of its fibers, the cohesion of such diverse disorders as\\nthose which characterize hysteria or hypochondria? How\\nconceive the liaison among the signs that from one part of\\nthe body to the other betray the presence of a nervous affection? How explain, and by tracing what line of connection,\\nthat in certain “delicate and highly sensitive” women a\\nheady perfume or the too vivid description of a tragic\\nevent or even the sight of a combat produces such an impression that they “fall into syncopes or suffer convulsions”? One seeks in vain: no precise liaison of the nerves;\\nno path proceeding from the original cause; but only a\\nremote, indirect action which is rather on the order of a\\nphysiological solidarity. This is because the different parts\\nof the body possess a “very determined faculty, which is\\neither general and extends throughout the entire system of\\nanimal economy, or particular and influences certain parts\\nprincipally.” This very distinct property of both “the\\nfaculty of feeling and that of moving” which permits the\\norgans to communicate with each other and to suffer together, to react to a stimulus, however distant—is sympathy. As a matter of fact, Whytt succeeded neither in\\nisolating sympathy in the ensemble of the nervous system,\\nnor in defining it in relation to sensibility and to movement,\\nSympathy exists in the organs only insofar as it is received\\nthere through the intermediary of the nerves; it is the more\\n\\n(75a)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nAspects of Madness\\n\\nmarked in proportion to their mobility, and at the same\\ntime it is one of the forms of sensibility: “All sympathy, all\\nconsensus presupposes sentiment and consequently can exist only by the mediation of the nerves, which are the only\\ninstruments by which sensation operates.”/* But the nervous system is no longer invoked here to explain the exact\\ntransmission of a movement or 2 sensation, but to justify, in\\nits totality and its mass, the body’s sensibility with regard\\nto its own phenomena, and its own echo across the volumes\\nof its organic space.\\n\\nDiseases of the nerves are essentially disorders of sympathy; they presuppose a state of general vigilance in the\\nnervous system which makes each organ susceptible of entering into sympathy with any other: “In such a state of\\nsensibility of the nervous system, the passions of the soul,\\nviolations of diet, sudden alternation of heat and cold or of\\nheaviness and humidity of the atmosphere, will very readily\\nproduce morbific symptoms; so that with such a constitution, one will not enjoy steady or constant health, but generally suffer a continual succession of more or less severe\\npains.” Doubtless this exaggerated sensibility is compensated by zones of insensibility, of sleep, as it were; in a\\ngeneral way, hysterical sufferers are those in whom this\\ninternal sensibility is the most exquisite, hypochondriacs\\npossessing it, on the contrary, in a relatively blunted form.\\nAnd of course women belong to the first category: is not\\nthe womb, with the brain, the organ that maintains most\\nsympathy with the whole organism? It suffices to cite “the\\nvomiting that generally accompanies the inflammation of\\nthe womb; the nausea, the disordered appetite that follow\\nconception; the constriction of the diaphragm and of the\\nmuscles of the abdomen during childbirth; the headache,\\nthe heat and the pains in the back, the intestinal colic\\nsuffered when the time of the menstrual flow approaches.”\\nThe entire female body is riddled by obscure but strangely\\n\\n(153)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavuness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\ndirect paths of sympathy; it is always in an immediate complicity with itself, to the point of forming a kind of absolutely privileged site for the sympathies; from one extrem~\\nity of its organic space to the other, it encloses a perpetual\\npossibility of hysteria. The sympathetic sensibility of her\\norganism, radiating through her entire body, condemns\\nwoman to those diseases of the nerves that are called vapors. “The women whose systems have generally more\\nmobility than those of men are more subject to nervous\\ndiseases, which are also more serious in them.” And\\nWhytt assures us he has witnessed that “the pain of a\\ntoothache caused convulsions in a young girl whose nerves\\nwere weak, and an unconsciousness lasting several hours\\nand returning when the pain became more acute.”\\n\\nDiseases of the nerves are diseases of corporeal continuity. A body too close to itself, too intimate in each of its\\nparts, an organic space which is, in a sense, strangely constricted: this is what the theme common to hysteria and\\nhypochondria has now become; the rapprochement of the\\nbody with itself assumes, for some, the aspect of a precise—\\nall too precise—image: such is the celebrated “shriveling of\\nthe nervous system” described by Pomme. Such image:\\nmask the problem, but do not suppress it, and do not keer\\nthe enterprise from continuing.\\n\\nIs this sympathy, basically, a property hidden in each\\norgan—that “sentiment” which Cheyne spoke of—or a real\\npropagation through an intermediary element? And is the\\npathological proximity which characterizes these nervout\\ndiseases an exasperation of this sentiment, or a greatel\\nmobility of this interstitial body?\\n\\nIr is a curious but doubtless characteristic phenomenot\\nof medical thought in the eighteenth century, in the perioc\\nwhen physiologists tried to define most precisely the func.\\ntions and the role of the nervous system (sensibility anc\\n\\n(i154)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c \\x0c Aspects of Madness\\n\\nirritability; sensation and movement), that physicians used\\nthese ideas indiscriminately in the undifferentiated unity of\\npathological perception, articulating them according to 2\\nschema entirely different from that proposed by physiol\\n EScasibility and movement are not distinguished. Tissot\\nexplains thar the child has more sensibiliry than anyone else\\nbecause in him everything is lighter and more mobile; irnitability, in the sense in which Haller understood a property of the nervous fiber, is identified with irritation, understood as the pathological state of an organ aroused by a\\nprolonged stimulus. It would thus be acknowledged that\\nnervous diseases were states of irritation combined with an\\nexcessive mobility of the fibers.\\n\\n“On occasion one sees persons for whom the smallest\\nmoving cause occasions much more movement than it produces in healthy persons; they cannot sustain the slightest alien impression. The faintest sound, the weakest light\\naffords them extraordinary symptoms.”?° By this deliberately preserved ambiguity in the notion of irritation, medicine at the end of the eighteenth century could in effect\\nshow the continuity between disposition (irritability) and\\nthe pathological event (irritation); but it could also maintain both the theme of a disorder proper to an organ which\\nsuffers, but in a fashion all its own, 2 general attack (it is\\nthe sensibility particular to the organ which assures this\\nnonetheless discontinuous communication), and the idea of\\na propagation in the organism of a single disorder that can\\nattack it in each of its parts (it is the mobility of the fiber\\nwhich is responsible for this continuity, despite the diverse\\nforms it assumes in the organs).\\n\\nBut if the notion of “irritated fiber” certainly plays this\\nrole of concerted confusion, it also permits a decisive distinction in pathology, On one hand, nervous sufferers are\\nthe most irritable, that is, have the most sensibility: tenu\\n(iss)\\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nousness of fiber, delicacy of organism; but they also have\\nan easily impressionable soul, an unquiet heart, too strong a\\nsympathy for what happens around them. This sort of universal resonance—simultaneously sensation and mobility—\\nconstitutes the first determination of the illness. Women\\nwho have “frail fibers,” who are easily carried away, in\\ntheir idleness, by the lively movements of their imagination,\\nare more often attacked by nervous diseases than men who\\nare “more robust, drier, hardened by work.” Buc this excess\\nof irritation has this peculiarity: that in its vivacity it attenuates, and sometimes ends by extinguishing, the sensations of the soul; as if the sensibility of the nervous organ\\nitself overcharged the soul’s capacity to feel, and appropriated for its own advantage the multiplicity of sensations\\naroused by its extreme mobility; the nervous system “is in\\nsuch a state of irritation and reaction that it is then incapable of transmitting to the soul what ir is experiencing; all\\nits figures are disordered; it can no longer interpret\\nthem.”?! Thus appears the idea of a sensibility which is not\\nsensation, and of an inverse relation between that delicacy\\nwhich derives as much from the soul as from the body, and\\na certain numbness of the sensations that prevents nervous\\nshocks from reaching the soul. The hysteric’s unconsciousness is only the reverse of his sensibility. It is this relation,\\nwhich the notion of sympathy could not define, which was\\ncontributed by the concept of irritability, though so little\\nelaborated and still so confused in the thinking of pathol\\nBut by this very fact, the moral significance of “nervous\\ncomplaints” was profoundly altered. Insofar as diseases of\\nthe nerves had been associated with the organic movements\\nof the lower parts of the body (even by the many and\\nconfused paths of sympathy), they were located within a\\ncertain ethic of desire: they represented the revenge of a\\ncrnde body; it had been as-the resule of an excessive vio\\n(rs56)\\n\\x0c  \\n\\n \\n\\nAspects of Madness\\n\\nlence that one became ill. From now on one fell ill from too\\nmuch feeling; one suffered from an excessive solidarity\\nwith all the beings around one. One was no longer compelled by one’s secret nature; one was the victim of everything which, on the surface of the world, solicited the body\\nand the soul.\\n\\nAnd as a result, one was both more innocent and more\\nguilty. More innocent, because one was swept by the total\\nirritation of the nervous system into an unconsciousness\\ngreat in proportion to one’s disease. But more guilty, much\\nmore guilty, because everything to which one was attached\\nin the world, the life one had led, the affections one had\\nhad, the passions and the imaginations one had cultivated\\ntoo complacently--all combined in the irritation of the\\nnerves, finding there both their natural effect and their\\nmoral punishment. All life was finally judged by this degree\\nof irritation: abuse of things that were not natural, the sedentary life of cities, novel reading, theatergoing, immoderate thirst for knowledge, “too fierce a passion for the sex, or\\nthat other criminal habit, as morally reprehensible as it is\\nphysically harmful.”** The innocence of the nervous sufferer, who no longer even feels the irritation of his nerves,\\nis at bottom only the just punishment of a deeper guile: the\\nguilt which makes him prefer the world to nature: “Terrible\\nstate! .. . This is the torment of all effeminate souls\\nwhom inaction has plunged into dangerous sensuality, and\\nwho, to rid themselves of the labors imposed by nature,\\nhave embraced all the phantoms of opinion. . . . Thus the\\nrich are punished for the deplorable use of their fortune.”\\n\\nWe stand here on the threshold of the nineteenth centary, where the irritability of the fibers will enjoy physiological and pathological fortunes. What it leaves for the\\nmoment, in the domain of nervous diseases, is nonetheless\\nsomething very important.\\n\\nThis is, on the one hand, the complete identification of\\n\\n(257)\\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMaovness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nhysteria and hypochondria as mental diseases. By the capital distinction between sensibility and sensation, they enter\\ninto that domain of unreason which we have seen was characterized by the essential moment of error and dream, that\\nis, of blindness. As long as vapors were convulsions or\\nstrange sympathetic communications through the body,\\neven when they led to fainting and loss of consciousness,\\nthey were not madness. But once the mind becomes blind\\nthrough the very excess of sensibilicy—then madness appears.\\n\\nBut on the other hand, such an identification gives madness 2 new content of guilt, of moral sanction, of just punishment which was not at all a part of the classical experience, It burdens unreason with all these new values: instead\\nof making blindness the condition of possibility for all the\\nmanifestations of madness, it describes blindness, the\\nblindness of madness, as the psychological effect of a moral\\nfault. And thereby compromises what had been essential\\nin the experience of unreason. What had been blindness\\nwould become unconsciousness, what had been error\\nwould become fault, and everything in madness that designated the paradoxical manifestation of non-being would\\nbecome the natural punishment of a moral evil. In short,\\nthat whole vertical hierarchy which constituted the structure of classical madness, from the cycle of material causes\\nto the transcendence of delirium, would now collapse and\\nspread over the surface of a domain which psychology and\\nmorality would soon occupy together and contest with\\neach other.\\n\\nThe “scientific psychiatry” of the nineteenth century\\nbecame possible.\\n\\nTt was in these “diseases of the nerves” and in these\\n“hysterias,” which would soon provoke its irony, that this\\npsychiatry took its origin.\\n\\n(758)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Vi\\n\\nis\\n\\nDOCTORS AND\\nPATIENTS\\n\\nTue therapeutics of madness did not function in the hospital, whose chief concern was to sever or to “correct.”\\nAnd yet in the non-hospital domain, treatment continued\\nto develop throughout the classical period: long cures for\\nmadness were elaborated whose aim was not so much to\\ncare for the soul as to cure the entire individual, his nervous\\nfiber as well as the course of his imagination. The mad~man’s body was regarded as the visible and solid presence of\\nhis disease: whence those physical cures whose meaning\\nwas borrowed from a moral perception and a moral therapeutics of the body.\\n\\n1. Consolidation. There exists in madness, even in its\\nmost agitated forms, an element of weakness. If in madness\\nthe spirits are subjected to irregular movements, it is because they have not enough strength or weight to follow\\nthe gravity of their natural course; if spasms and convul\\n(zs9)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Mavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nsions so often occur in nervous illnesses, it is because the\\nfiber is too mobile, or too irritable, or too sensitive to vibrations; in any case, it lacks robusmess. Beneath the apparent\\nviolence of madness, which sometimes seems to multiply\\nthe strength of maniacs to considerable proportions, there\\nis always a secret weakness, an essential lack of resistance;\\nthe madman’s frenzies, in fact, are only a passive violence. What is wanted, then, is a cure that will give the\\nspirits or the fibers a vigor, but a calm vigor, a strength no\\ndisorder can mobilize, since from the start it will be subject\\nto the course of natural law. More than the image of vivacity and vigor, it is one of robustness that prevails, enveloping the theme in a new resistance, a young elasticity, but\\nsubjugated and already domesticated. A force must be\\nfound within nature to reinforce nature itself.\\n\\nThe ideal remedy would “take the part” of the spirits,\\nand “help them conquer the cause that ferments them.” To\\ntake the part of the spirits would be to struggle against the\\nvain agitation to which they are subject in spite of themselves; it would also permit them to escape from all the\\nchemical ebullition that heats and troubles them; finally it\\nwould give them enough solidity to resist the vapors that\\ntry to suffocate them, to make them inert, and to carry\\nthem off in their whirlwind. Against the vapors, the spirits\\nare reinforced “by the most stinking odors”; disagreeable\\nsensation vivifies the spirits, which in a sense rebel and\\nvigorously flock to the place where the assault must\\nbe repelled; to this effect “asafetida, oil of amber, burnt\\nleather and feathers will be used—that is, whatever can\\nprovide the soul with strong and disagreeable feelings.”\\nAgainst fermentation, theriac must be given, “anti-epileptic\\nspirits of Charras,” or best of all, the famous Queen of\\nHungary water;? acidity disappears and the spirits regain\\ntheir true influence. Finally, to restore their true mobilicy,\\nLange recommends that the spirits be subjected to sensa\\n(160)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Doctors and Patients\\n\\ntions and movements that are both agreeable, measured,\\nand regular: “When the animal spirits are dispersed and\\ndisunited, remedies are necessary which calm their movement and return them to their natural situation, such things\\nas give the soul a sweet and moderate feeling of pleasure:\\nagreeable odors, walks in delightful spots, the sight of persons who are in the habit of providing diversion, and\\nMusic.” This firm gentleness, a proper gravity, ultimately a\\nvivacity intended only to protect the body—all these are\\nmeans to consolidate, within the organism, the fragile elements connecting body and soul.\\n\\nBut there is probably no better fortifying procedure\\nthan the use of the substance which is both the most solid\\nand the most docile, the most resistant but the most pliable\\nin the hands of the man who knows how to forge it to his\\npurposes; iron. Iron unites, in its privileged nature, all chose\\nqualities that quickly become contradictory when they are\\nisolated, Nothing resists better, nothing can better obey; it\\nis a gift of nature, but it is also at the disposal of all of man’s\\ntechniques, How could man help nature and lend it an\\nabundance of strength by a surer means—that is, one closer\\nto nature and more obedient to man—than by the application of iron? The old example of Dioscorides is always\\ncited, who gave to the inertia of water the vigorous virtues\\nforeign to it by plunging into it a bar of red-hot iron. The\\nardor of fire, the calm mobility of water, the rigor of a\\nmetal treated until it had become supple—all these elements, united, conferred upon water powers of reinforceent, of vivification, of consolidation, which it could transmit to the organism. But iron is efficacious even aside from\\nany preparation; Sydenham recommends it in its simplest\\nform, by the direct absorption of iron filings. Whytt instances a man who, in order to cure himself of a weakness\\nof the stomach nerves involving a permanent state of hypochondria, took 230 grains of iron every day. This was\\n\\n(1671)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c MADNESS & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nbecause to all its virtues, iron added the remarkable property of transmitting itself directly, without intermediary or\\ntransformation. What it communicated was not its substance but its strength; paradoxically, though itself so re~\\nsistant, it immediately dissolved in the organism, depositing\\nthere only its qualities, without rust or waste. It is evident\\nhere that an imagery of wonder-working iron governs discursive thought and prevails over observation itself. If\\nexperiments were made, it was not to reveal a positive sequence of effects, but to emphasize this immediate communication of qualities. Wright fed a dog Mars salts; he\\nobserved that an hour later the chyle, if mixed with tincture of nut gall, did not display that purple color it invariably assumed if the iron had been absorbed. This must have\\nbeen because the iron, without mixing with the digestion, without passing into the blood, without penetrating\\nthe organism substantially, fortified the membranes and\\nfibers directly. More than an observed effect, the consolidation of the spirits and the nerves appears rather as an operative metaphor which implies a transfer of strength without\\nany discursive dynamics, Strength is supplied by contact,\\nexclusive of any exchange or substance, any communication\\nof movements.\\n\\n2. Purification, Clogging of the viscera, ebullition of\\nfalse ideas, fermentation of vapors, violence, corruption of\\nliquids and spirits—madness elicits an entire series of therapeutics, each of which can be attached to the identical\\noperation of purification.\\n\\nThe ideal was a sort of total purification: the simplest\\nbut also the most impossible of cures. It would consist of\\nsubstituting for the melancholic’s overcharged, thick blood,\\nencumbered with bitter humors, a light, clear blood whose\\nnew movement would dissipate the delirium. In 1662 Moritz Hoffman suggested blood transfusion as a remedy for\\nmelancholia. Some years later, the idea had attained suffi\\n(162)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Doctors and Patients\\n\\ncient currency for the Philosophical Society of London to\\nplan a series of experiments upon the subjects confined in\\nBedlam; Allen, the doctor entrusted with the enterprise,\\nrefused, But Jean-Baptiste Denis tried it upon one of his\\npatients stricken with amorous melancholia; he drew off\\nten ounces of blood, which he replaced with a slightly\\nsmaller quantity taken from the femoral artery of a calf;\\nthe following day he began again, but this time the operation involved only a few ounces. The patient became calm;\\nthe following day his mind cleared; he was soon entirely\\ncured; “all the professors of the Academy of Surgeons attested it.” The technique, however, was quickly abandoned, despite a few later attempts.\\n\\nThe preferred medications were those that forestalled\\ncorruption. We know “as a result of more than three thousand years of experience that Myrrh and Aloes preserve\\ncorpses.” Are not these deteriorations of bodies of the\\nsame nature as those that accompany the diseases of the\\nhumors? Then nothing would be more recommendable\\nagainst the vapors than products like myrrh or aloes, and\\nespecially the famous elixir of Paracelsus. But more must be\\nattempted than to forestall corruptions; they must be destroyed. Whence the therapeutics that attack deterioration\\nitself, and seek either to deflect the corrupt substances or to\\ndissolve the corrupting ones: techniques of deflection and\\ntechniques of detersion.\\n\\nTo the first belong all the strictly physical methods chat\\nseek to create wounds or sores on the surface of the body,\\nboth centers of infection that relieve the organism, and centers of evacuation into the outside world, Thus Fallowes\\nexplains the beneficial mechanism of his olewm cephalicum;\\nin madness, “black vapors clog the very fine vessels\\nthrough which the animal spirits must pass”; the blood is\\nthus deprived of direction; it encumbers the veins of the\\nbrain where it stagnates, unless it is agitated by a confused\\n\\n(163)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Mavwness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nmovement “that distracts the ideas.” Olewm cephalicum has\\nthe advantage of provoking “little pustules on the head”;\\nthey are anointed with oil to keep them from drying out\\nand so that “the black vapors lodged in the brain” may\\ncontinue to escape. But buming and cauterizing the body\\nat any point produces the same effect. It was even supposed\\nthat diseases of the skin such as scabies, eczema, or smallpox\\ncould put an end to a fit of madness; the corruption then\\nleft the viscera and the brain, to spread on the surface of\\nthe body, where it was released externally. By the end of\\nthe century, it became customary to inoculate scabies in the\\nmost resistant cases of mania. In his Instructions of 1785,\\naddressed to the directors of hospitals, Frangois Doublet\\nrecommends that if bleedings, purges, baths, and showers\\ndo not cure mania, the use of “cauters, setons, superficial\\nabscesses, inoculation of scabies” will.\\n\\nBut the principal task is to dissolve the fermentations\\nwhich, having formed in the body, give rise to madness. To\\naccomplish this, the chief agent is bitters, Bitterness has all\\nthe harsh virtues of sea water; it purifies by wearing away,\\nit works its corrosion on everything useless, unhealthy, and\\nimpure that the disease may have deposited in the body and\\nthe soul. Bitter and active, coffee is useful for “fat persons\\nwhose thickened humors circulate with difficulty”; it dries\\nwithout burning—for it is the property of such substances\\nto dissipate superfluous humidity without dangerous heat;\\nthere is in coffee, as it were, fire without flame, a purifying\\npower that does not calcine; coffee reduces impurities:\\n“those who take it feel by long experience that it restores\\nthe stomach, consumes its superfluous humidity, dissipates\\nwind, dissolves the phlegm of the bowels, where it performs a mild abstersion, and what is most considerable,\\nprevents the fumes from rising to the head and consequently reduces the aches and pains customarily suffered\\n\\n(164)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\n \\n\\nI\\n\\n“ STULTIFERA\\nN AVIS”\\n\\nAr the end of the Middle Ages, leprosy disappeared from\\nthe Western world. In the margins of the community, at\\nthe gates of cities, there stretched wastelands which sickness had ceased to haunt but had left sterile and long uninhabitable. For centuries, these reaches would belong to\\nthe non-human. From the fourteenth to the seventeenth\\ncentury, they would wait, soliciting with strange incantations a new incarnation of disease, another grimace of terror, renewed rites of purification and exclusion.\\n\\nFrom the High Middle Ages to the end of the Crusades,\\nleprosariums had multiplied their cities of the damned over\\nthe entire face of Europe. According to Mathieu Paris,\\nthere were as many as 19,000 of them throughout Christendom. In any case, around 1226, when Louis VIII established the lazar-house law for France, more than 2,000\\nappeared on the official registers. There were 43 in the\\n\\n(3)\\n\\x0c Doctors and Patients\\n\\nthere; finally, it affords strength, vigor, and cleanliness to\\nthe animal spirits, without leaving any great impression of\\nheat, even upon the most inured persons who are accustomed to use it.”® Bitter, but tonic also, is the quinine\\nWhytt freely prescribes to persons “whose nervous system\\nis very delicate”; it is efficacious against “weakness, discouragement, and depression”; two years of a cure consisting only of a tincture of quinine, “occasionally discontinued for a month at most,” were sufficient to cure a woman\\nsuffering from a nervous complaint. For delicate persons,\\nquinine must be associated with “a bitterness pleasant to the\\ntaste”; but if the organism is able to withstand stronger\\nattacks, vitriol, mixed with quinine, cannot be too strongly\\nrecommended, Twenty or thirty drops of elixir of vitriol\\nare sovereign.\\n\\nQuite naturally, soaps and soap products inevitably enjoy privileged effects in this purificatory enterprise. “Soap\\ndissolves almost anything that is concrete.’* Tissot believes\\nthat soap can be consumed directly, and that it will calm\\nmany nervous ailments; but more often it is sufficient to\\nconsume, first thing in the morning, by themselves or with\\nbread, “soapy fruits’—that is, cherries, strawberries, currants, figs, oranges, grapes, ripe pears, and “other fruits of\\nthis nature.” But there are cases where the difficulty is so\\nserious, the obstruction so irreducible, that no soap can\\nconquer it. Soluble tartar is then recommended. Muzzell\\nwas the first to have the idea of prescribing tartar for “madness and melancholia,” and published several. triumphant\\nobservations on the subject. Whytt confirms them, and\\nshows at rhe same time that tartar functions as a detersive,\\nsince it is especially efficacious against obstructive illnesses:\\n“Insofar as I have observed it, soluble tartar is more useful in\\nmaniac or melancholic affections produced by harmful\\nhumors amassed in the primary canals, than for those pro\\n(165)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nduced by a flaw in the brain.” Among the dissolvants,\\nRaulin also cites honey, chimney soot, Oriental saffron,\\nwood lice, powdered lobster claw, and bezoar.\\n\\nHalfway between these internal methods of dissolution\\nand the external techniques of deflection, we find a series of\\npractices of which the most frequent are applications of\\nvinegar. As an acid, vinegar dissolves obstructions, destroys\\nforeign bodies as they are fermenting. But in external application, it can serve as a revulsive, and draw harmful\\nhumors and liquids to the surface. It is curious but quite\\n\\n’ characteristic of the therapeutic thinking of this period\\nthat no contradiction was admitted between thése two\\nmodes of action. Given what it is by nature—detersive and\\nrevulsive—vinegar would act in any situation according to\\nthis double determination, even though one of these two\\nmodes of action can no longer be analyzed in a rational and\\ndiscursive fashion. It functions, then, directly, without intermediary, through the simple contact of two natural elements, Hence it is recommended to rub the head, shaved if\\npossible, with vinegar. The Gazette de médecine cites the\\ncase of an empiric who managed to cure “a quantity of\\nmadmen by a very swift and very simple means. Here is his\\nsecret, After he has purged them above and below, he has\\nthem soak their head and hands in vinegar, and leaves them\\nin this situation until they fall asleep, or rather until they\\nwake up, and most of them are cured upon waking. He also\\napplies to the patient’s shaved head chopped leaves of Dipsacus, or fuller’s weed.”\\n\\n3lmmersion. Here two themes intersect: the theme of\\nablution, with all that relates it to the rites of purity and\\nrebirth; and the much more physiological theme of impregnation or immersion, which modifies the essential qualities of liquids and solids. Despite their differenc origin, and\\nthe gap between their levels of conceptual elaboration, they\\nform, up to the end of the eighteenth century, a unity\\n\\n(166)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Doctors and Patients\\n\\ncoherent enough so that their opposition is not experienced\\nas such. The idea of nature, with its ambiguities, serves as\\ntheir element of cohesion. Water, the simple and primitive\\nliquid, belongs to all that is purest in nacure; all the dubious\\nmodifications man has been able to add to nature’s essential\\nkindness cannot change the beneficence of water; when\\ncivilization, life in society, the imaginary desires aroused by\\nnovel reading and theatergoing provoke nervous ailments,\\nthe rerurn to water’s limpidity assumes the meaning of a\\nritual of purification; in that transparent coolness, one is\\nreborn to one’s first innocence. But at the same time, the\\nwater naturally inherent in the composition of all bodies\\nrestores each to its own equilibrium; water serves as a\\nuniversal physiological regulator. All these themes were\\nexpressed by Tissot, a disciple of Rousseau, whose imagination was as moral as it was medical: “Nature has prescribed\\nwater as the unique beverage of all nations; she gave it the\\npower to dissolve all sorts of nourishment; it is agreeable to\\nthe palate; choose therefore a good cold water, fresh and\\nlight; it fortifies and cleans the bowels; the Greeks and\\nRomans regarded it as a universal remedy.”\\n\\nThe practice of immersion reaches far back into the history of madness; the baths taken at Epidaurus alone would\\nbear witness to this; and cold applications of all kinds must\\nhave been current throughout antiquity, since Soranus of\\nEphesus, if we are to believe Caelius Aurelianus, already\\nprotested against their abuse. In the Middle Ages, the traditional treatment of a maniac was to plunge him several\\ntimes into water “until he had lost his strength and forgotten his fury.” Franciscus Sylvius recommends immersions\\nin cases of melancholia or frenzy. And the story, accepted\\nin the eighteenth century, of Van Helmont’s sudden discovery of the usefulness of hydrotherapy, was actually a\\nreinterpretation. According to Menuret, this invention,\\nsupposedly dating from the middle of the seventeenth cen\\n(267)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Mavness & CivILIZATION\\n\\ntury, was the fortunate result of chance: a heavily chained\\nmadman was being transported on an open wagon; he managed, however, to free himself from his chains and jumped\\ninto a lake, tried to swim, fainred,; when he was rescued,\\neveryone thought he was dead, but he quickly recovered\\nhis spirits, which were abruptly restored to their natural\\norder, and he “lived a long time without experiencing any\\nfurther attack of madness.” This anecdote supposedly enlightened Van Helmont, who began to plunge the insane\\nindiscriminately into the sea or into fresh water; “the only\\ncare that must be taken, is to plunge the sufferers into the\\nwater suddenly and unawares, and to keep them there for a\\nJong time. One need have no fear for their lives.” \\nThe trath of the story is of little importance; one thing is\\ncertain, which it conveys in the form of an anecdote: from\\nthe end of the seventeenth century, the water cure takes or\\nregains its place as a major therapeutics of madness. When\\nDoubler published his Instructions shortly before the Revolution, he prescribed, for the four major pathological\\nforms he recognized (frenzy, mania, melancholia, imbecility), the regular use of baths, adding the use of cold showers for the first two. And at this period, Cheyne had\\nalready long since recommended that “all those who need\\nto fortify their temperament” install baths in their house,\\nand use them every two, three, or four days; or “if they\\nhave not the means, to bathe in some manner either in a lake\\nor in running water, whenever they have occasion.”\\n\\nThe advantages of water are evident, to 2 medicine\\ndominated by the concern to equilibrate liquids and solids.\\nFor if water has powers of impregnation, which place it\\nfirst among the humectants, it has, insofar as it can receive\\nsupplementary qualities like cold and heat, the virtues of\\nconstriction, of cooling or of heating, and it can even have\\nthose effects of consolidation attributed to substances like\\niron. In fact, the interplay of qualities is very labile, in the\\n\\n(168)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Doctors and Patients\\n\\nfluid substance of water; just as it penetrates easily into the\\nweb of all the tissues, it may be easily impregnated by all\\nthe qualitative influences to which it is subjected. Paradoxically, its universal use in the eighteenth century was not\\nthe result of a general recognition of its effect and mode of\\naction, but of the ease with which the most contradictory\\nforms and modalities could be attributed to its action. It is |\\nthe locus of all possible therapeutic themes, forming an inexhaustible reservoir of operative metaphors. In this fluid\\nelement occurs the universal exchange of qualities,\\n\\nOf course, cold water cools. Otherwise would it be used\\nin frenzy and mania—diseases of heat, in which che spirits\\nboil, solids stretch, liquids seethe to the point of evaporation, leaving the brains of these sufferers “dry and fragile,”\\nas anatomy can daily testify? Reasonably enough, Barthélemy-Camille Boissieu cites cold water among the essential\\nmeans of cooling cures; as a bath, it comes first among the\\n“antiphlogistics” which tear from the body the excessive\\nigneous particles found there; as a drink, it is a “procrastinative dilution” which diminishes the resistance of fluids to\\nthe actions of solids, and thus indirectly lowers the general\\nheat of the body.\\n\\nBut it can just as well be said that cold water heats and\\nhot water cools. It is precisely this thesis which Daruc defends. Cold baths attack the blood that is at the periphery\\nof the body and “drive it more vigorously toward the\\nheart.” But the heart being the seat of natural heat, there\\nthe blood is heated, especially because “the heart, which\\nstruggles alone against the other parts, makes new efforts to\\ndrive out the blood and to overcome the resistance of the\\ncapillaries. Whence a great intensity of circulation, the division of the blood, the fluidity of the humors, the destruction of the encumbrances, the augmentation of the forces\\nof natural heat, of the appetite of the digestive forces, of\\nthe activity of the body and the mind.” The paradox of the\\n\\n(169)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Maovness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nhot bath is symmetrical: it draws the blood to the periphery, as well as the humors, perspiration, and all liquids,\\nuseful or harmful. Thus the vital centers are relieved; the\\nheart now must function slowly; and the organism is\\nthereby cooled. Is not this fact confirmed by “those syncopes, those lipothymias, that weakness, that lack of vigor”\\nwhich accompany the too constant use of hot baths?\\nFurther still: so rich is water\\'s polyvalence, so great its\\naptitude for submitting to the qualities it bears, that it even\\nmanages to lose its efficacity as a liquid, and to act as a\\ndesiccant. Water can conjure away humidity. It revives the\\nold principle “like to like,” but in another sense, and by the\\nintermediary of an entire visible mechanism. For some, it is\\ncold water that dries, heat on the contrary preserving\\nwater’s humidiry. Heat, in fact, dilates the pores of the\\norganism, distends its membranes, and permits humidity to\\nimpregnate them by a secondary effect. Heat clears the\\nway for liquids. It is precisely for this reason that all the\\nhot drinks the seventeenth century used and abused risk\\nbecoming harmful: relaxation, general humidiry, softness\\nof the entire organism—this is what threatens those who\\nconsume too many such infusions. And since these are the\\ndistinctive traits of the female body, as opposed to virile\\ndryness and solidity, the abuse of hot drinks risks leading to\\na general feminization of the human race: “Most men are\\ncensured, not without reason, for having degenerated in\\ncontracting the softness, the habits, and the inclinations of\\nwomen; there is lacking only a resemblance in bodily constitution. Excessive use of humectants immediately accelerates the metamorphosis and makes the two sexes almost as\\nalike in the physical as in the moral realm. Woe to the\\nhuman race, if this prejudice extends its reign co the common people; there will be no more plowmen, artisans, soldiers, for they will soon be robbed of the strength and\\nvigor necessary to their profession.”* In cold water, it is\\n\\n(170)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Dactors and Patients\\n\\nthe cold that vanquishes all the powers of humidity, for by\\ntightening the tissues, it closes them to all possibility of\\nimpregnation: “Do we not see how much the vessels, the\\ntissues of our flesh tighten when we wash in cold water or\\nwhen we are numbed with cold?”* Cold baths thus have\\nthe paradoxical property of consolidating the organism, of\\nguaranteeing it against the softness of humidity, of “giving\\ntone to the parts,” as Hoffmann said, “and augmenting the\\nsystaltic power of the heart and the vessels.”\\n\\nBut in other qualitative intuitions, the relationship is reversed; here it is heat that dries up water\\'s humectant prop~\\nerties, while cold ceaselessly preserves and renews them.\\nAgainst diseases of the nerves due to “a shriveling of the\\nnervous system” and “the dryness of the membranes,”\\nPomme does not recommend hot baths—which abet the\\nheat that reigns in the body—but tepid or cold baths that\\ncan permeate the tissues of the organism and restore their\\nsuppleness. Is this not the method spontaneously practiced\\nin America? And are not its effects, its very mechanism\\nvisible to the naked eye in the development of the cure,\\nsince at the most acute point of the crisis, the sufferers float\\nin the water of the bath—to such an extent has internal\\nheat rarified the air and the liquids of their bodies; yet if\\nthey remain a long time in the bath water, “three, four, or\\neven six hours a day,” then relaxation takes place, the\\nwater gradually impregnates the membranes and the fibers,\\nthe body becomes heavy and sinks naturally to the bottom.\\n\\nAt the end of the eighteenth century, the powers of\\nwater wane in the very excess of its qualitative versatility:\\ncold, it can heat; hot, it can cool; instead of humidifying, it\\nis even capable of solidifying, of petrifying by cold, or of\\nsustaining a fire with its own heat. In it, all the values of\\nbeneficence and maleficence indiscriminately combine. It is\\nendowed with all possible complicities. In medical thought,\\nit forms a therapeutic theme which can be used and ma\\n(777)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Mavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nnipolated unconditionally, and whose effect can be understood im the most diverse physiologies and pathologies. It\\nhas so many values, so many different modes of action, that\\nit can confirm anything, cancel anything. No doubt it was\\nthis very polyvalence, with all the disputes it generated,\\nthat finally neutralized water. By Pinel’s day, water was\\nstill used, but ir had again become entirely limpid, its qualitative overtones had been eliminated, and its mode of action\\ncould no longer be anything but mechanical.\\n\\nShowers, hitherto less used than baths and drinks, now\\nbecome the favored technique. And paradoxically, water\\nregains, beyond all the physiological variations of the preceding epoch, its simple function of purification, The only\\nquality attributed to it is violence, an irresistible flow washing away all the impurities that form madness; by its own\\ncurative power, it reduces the individual to his simplest\\npossible expression, to his merest and purest form of existence, thus affording him a second birth; it is a matter, Pinel\\nexplains, “of destroying even the smallest traces of the ex~\\ntravagant ideas of the insane, which can be done only by\\nobliterating, so to speak, these ideas in a state close to that\\nof death.” Whence the famous techniques used in asylums\\nlike Charenton at the end of the eighreenth and the beginning of the nineteenth century: the shower proper—“the\\ninsane man, fastened to an armchair, was placed beneath a\\nreservoir filled with cold water which poured directly\\nupon his head through a large pipe”; and surprise baths—\\n“the sufferer came down the corridors to the ground floor,\\nand arrived in a square vaulted room, in which a pool had\\nbeen constructed; he was pushed over backwards and into\\nthe water.”? Such violence promised the rebirth of 2 baptism.\\n\\n4+ Regulation of Movement. If it is true that madness is\\nthe irregular agitation of the spiries, the disordered movement of fibers and ideas, it is also obstruction of the body\\n\\n(172)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Doctors and Patients\\n\\nand the soul, stagnation of the humors, immobilization of\\nthe fibers in their rigidity, fixation of ideas and attention on\\na theme that gradually prevails over all others. Ir is then a\\nmatter of restoring to the mind and to the spirits, to the\\nbody and to the soul, the mobility which gives them life.\\nThis mobility, however, must be measured and controlled;\\nit must not become a vain agitation of the fibers which no\\nlonger obey the stimuli of the exterior world. The animating idea of this therapeutic theme is the restitution of a\\nmovement that corresponds to the prudent mobility of the\\nexterior world. Since madness can be dumb immobility,\\nobstinate fixation as well as disorder and agitation, the cure\\nconsists in reviving in the sufferer a movement that will be\\nboth regular and real, in the sense that it will obey the rules\\nof the world’s movements.\\n\\nPhysicians of the period evoke the firm belief of the ancients, who attributed salutary effects to various forms of\\nwalking and running: simple walking, which both limbers .\\nand strengthens the body; running at an ever increasing\\nspeed, which better distributes the juices and humors\\nthroughout the body, at the same time that it diminishes the\\nweight of the organs; running fully dressed, which heats\\nand loosens the tissues, softens too rigid fibers. Sydenham\\nespecially recommends horseback riding in cases of melancholia and hypochondria: “But the best thing I have yet\\nfound to fortify and animate the blood and the spirits, is to\\ntide almost every day, and in this manner to make rather\\nlong excursions in the fresh air. This exercise, by the extraordinary jolting it causes the lungs and especially the\\nviscera of the lower stomach, rids the blood of the excremental humors that reside there, gives resilience to the\\nfibers, re-establishes the functions of the organs, reanimates\\nnatural heat, evacuates degenerate juices by perspiration or\\nother means, or else re-establishes them in their previous\\nstate, dissipates obstructions, opens all passages, and finally,\\n\\n(173)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Mavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nthrough the continual movement it causes the blood, renews it, so to speak, and accords it an extraor vigor.\" The rolling of the sea, the most regular, the most\\nnatural movement in the world, and the one most in accord\\nwith cosmic order—that same movement which De Lancre\\nonce considered so dangerous for the human heart, offering\\nas it did so many hazardous temptations, improbable and\\nalways unfulfilled dreams, constitutive of the image, in\\nfact, of infinite evil—was considered by the eighteenth century as a powerful regulator of organic mobility. In it, the\\nvery rhythm of nature spoke. Gilchrist wrote an entire\\ntreatise “fon the use of sea voyages in Medicine”, Whytt\\nfound the remedy difficult to apply to those subject to\\nmelancholia; it is “difficult to convince such patients to undertake a long sea voyage, but a case must be cited of\\nhypochondriacal vapors that immediately disappeared in a\\nyoung man who was constrained to travel in a ship for four\\nor five weeks.”\\n\\nTravel has the additional interest of acting directly upon\\nthe flow of ideas, or at least by 2 more direct means, since it\\npasses only through the sensations. The variety of the landscape dissipates the melancholic’s obstinacy: a remedy in\\nuse since antiquity, but which the eighteenth century prescribed with a new insistence, and whose forms it varied,\\nfrom real travel to the imaginary voyages of literature and\\nthe theater. Antoine le Camus prescribes “in order to relax\\nthe brain” in all cases of vaporous affections: “walks, journeys, rides, exercise in the fresh air, dancing, spectacles,\\ndiverting reading, occupations that can cause the obsessive\\nidea to be forgotten.” The country, by the gentleness and\\nvariety of its landscapes, wins melancholics from their\\nsingle obsession “by taking them away from the places that\\nmight revive the memory of their sufferings.”\\n\\nBut inversely, the agitation of mania can be corrected by\\nthe good effects of a regular movement. This is no longer a\\n\\n(174)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMaowness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\ndiocese of Paris alone: these included Bourg-le-Reine, Corbeil, Saint-Valére, and the sinister Champ-Pourri (Rotten\\nField); included also was Charenton. The two largest were\\nin the immediate vicinity of Paris: Saint-Germain and SaintLazare:* we shall hear their names again in the history of\\nanother sickness, This is because from the fifteenth century\\non, all were emptied; in the next century Saint-Germain\\nbecame a reformatory for young criminals; and before the\\ntime of Saint Vincent there was only one leper left at SaintLazare, “Sieur Langlois, practitioner in the civil court.”\\nThe lazar house of Nancy, which was among the largest in\\nEurope, had only four inmates during the regency of Marie\\nde Médicis. According to Catel’s Mémoires, there were 29\\nhospitals in Toulouse at the end of the medieval period:\\nseven were leprosariums; but at the beginning of the seventeenth century we find only three mentioned: Saint-Cyprien, Arnaud-Bernard, and Saint-Michel. It was a pleasure\\nto celebrate the disappearance of leprosy: in 1635 the inhabitants of Reims formed a solemn procession to thank\\nGod for having delivered their city from this scourge.\\n\\nFor a century already, royal authority had undertaken\\nthe control and reorganization of the immense fortune\\nrepresented by the endowments of the lazar houses; in a\\ndecree of December 19, 1543, Francois I had a census and\\ninventory taken “to remedy the great disorder that exists at\\npresent in the lazar houses”; in his turn, Henri IV in an\\nedict of 1606 prescribed a revision of their accounts and\\nallotted “the sums obtained from this investigation to the\\nsustenance of poor noblemen and crippled soldiers,” The\\nsame request for regulation is recorded on October 24,\\n1612, but the excess revenues were now to be used for\\nfeeding the poor.\\n\\nIn fact, the question of the leprosariums was not settled\\nin France before the end of the seventeenth century; and\\nthe problem’s economic importance provoked more than\\none conflict. Were there not still, in the year 1677, 44 lazar\\n\\n(4)\\n\\x0c Doctors and Patients\\n\\nrestoring of motion but a regulation of agitation, momentarily stopping its course, fixing the attention. Travel is\\nefficacious not by its incessant breaks in continuity, but by\\nthe novelty of the objects it affords, by the curiosity to\\nwhich it gives birth. It should permit the external distraction of a mind which has escaped all control, and has escaped from itself in the vibration of its interior movement.\\n“Tf one can discover objects or persons who may be able to\\ndistract the attention from the pursuit of deranged ideas\\nand who may be able to fix it somewhat upon others, they\\nmust be presented often to maniacs; and it is for this reason\\nthat advantages may often be obtained from travel, which\\ninterrupts the sequence of former ideas and offers objects\\nthat fix the attention.”®\\n\\nUtilized for the changes it affords in melancholia, or for\\nthe regularity it imposes upon mania, the therapeutics of\\nmovement conceals the idea of a seizure by the world of\\nthe alienated mind. It is both a “falling in step” and a conversion, since movement prescribes its rhythm, but constitutes, by its novelty or variety, 2 constant appeal to the\\nmind to leave itself and return to the world. If it is true that\\nthe techniques of immersion always concealed the ethical,\\nalmost religious memories of ablution, of a second birth, in\\nthese cures by movement we can also recognize a symmetrical moral theme, but one that is the converse of the\\nfirst: to return to the world, to entrust oneself to its wisdom by returning to one’s place in the. general order of\\nthings, thus forgetting madness, which is the moment of\\npure subjectivity. We see how even in empiricism, the\\nmeans of cure encounter the great organizing structures of\\nthe experience of madness in the classical period. Being\\nboth error and sin, madness is simultaneously impurity and\\nsolitude; it is withdrawn from the world, and from truth;\\nbut ic is by that very fact imprisoned in evil. Its double\\nnothingness is to be the visible form of that non-being\\n\\n(775)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Manvwness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nwhich is evil, and to utter, in the void and in the sensational\\nappearances of its delirium, the non-being of error. It is\\ntotally pure, since it is nothing if nor the evanescent point\\nof a subjectivity from which all presence of the truth has\\nbeen removed; and totally impure, since this nothingness is\\nthe non-being of evil. The technique of cure, down to its\\nphysical symbols most highly charged with iconographic\\nintensity—consolidation and return to movement on the\\none hand, purification and immersion on the other—is secretly organized around these two fundamental themes: the\\n. Subject must be restored to his initial purity, and must be\\nwrested from his pure subjectivity in order to be initiated\\ninto the world; the non-being that alienates him from himself must be annihilated, and he must be restored to the\\nplenitude of the exterior world, to the solid truth of being.\\n\\nThe techniques were to subsist longer than their meaning. When, outside the experience of unreason, madness\\nhad received a purely psychological and moral status, when\\nthe relations of error and fault by which classicism defined\\nmadness were crammed into the single notion of guilt, the\\ntechniques still remained, but with a much more restricted\\nsignificance; all that was sought was a mechanical effect, or\\na moral punishment. It was in this manner that the methods of regulating movement degenerated into the famous\\n“rotatory machine” whose mechanism and efficacity were\\ndemonstrated by Mason Cox at the beginning of the nineteenth century:** a perpendicular pillar is attached to both\\nfloor and ceiling; the sufferer is attached to a chair or a bed\\nhung from a horizontal arm moving around the pillar; by\\nmeans of a “not very complicated system of gears” the\\nmachine is set for “the degree of speed desired.” Cox cites\\none of his own observations; it concerns a man whom melancholia had thrown into a kind of stupor: “His complexion was dark and leaden, his eyes yellow, his looks constantly fixed upon the ground, his limbs motionless, his\\n\\n(276)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nDoctors and Patients\\n\\ntongue dry and paralyzed, and his pulse slow.” This sufferer\\nwas placed upon the rotatory machine, which was set at an\\nincreasingly rapid movement. The effect surpassed expectation; the sufferer became excessively disturbed: melancholic rigidity gave way to manic agitation. But this first\\neffect passed, and the invalid relapsed into his initial state.\\nThe rhythm was then changed; the machine was made to\\nturn very rapidly, but it was stopped at regular intervals,\\nand in a very abrupt manner. The melancholia was driven\\nout, without the rotation having had time to release the\\nmanic agitation, This “centrifugation” of melancholia is\\nvery characteristic of the new use of the old therapeutic\\nthemes. Movement no longer aimed at restoring the invalid\\nto the truth of the exterior world, but only at producing a\\nseries of internal effects, purely mechanical and purely\\npsychological. It was no longer the presence of the truth\\nthat determined the cure, but a functional norm. In this\\nreinterpretation of the old method, the organism was no\\nlonger related to anything but itself and its own nature,\\nwhile in the initial version, what was to be restored was its\\nrelation with the world, its essential link with being and\\nwith truth: if we add that the rotatory machine was soon\\nused as a threat and a punishment, we see the impoverishment of the meanings which had richly sustained the therapeutic methods throughout the entire classical period. Medicine was now content to regulate and to punish, with\\nmeans which had once served to exorcise sin, to dissipate\\nerror in the restoration of madness to the world’s obvious\\ntruth.\\n\\nIn 1771, Bienville wrote apropos of Nymtphomania that\\nthere were times when it could be cured “merely by treating the imagination; but there were none or almost none\\nwhen physical remedies alone could effect a radical cure.”\\nAnd a litde later, Beauchesne: “One would undertake in\\n\\n(#77)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Mavwness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nvain to cure a man suffering from madness, if one tried to\\nsucceed by physical means alone. . . . Material remedies\\ncan never enjoy a complete success without that succor\\nwhich a strong and healthy mind affords a weak and sick\\none.”\\n\\nSuch texts do not discover the necessity of a psychological treatment; rather they mark the end of an era: the era\\n‘when the difference between physical medicaments and\\nmoral treatments was not yet accepted as obvious by medical thought. The unity of the symbols begins to break\\ndown, and the techniques lose their total significance. They\\nare no longer credited with more than a local efficacity—on\\nthe body or on the soul. The cure again changes direction;\\nit is no longer determined by the meaningful unity of the\\ndisease, organized around its major qualities; but, segment\\nby segment, must address itself to the various elements that\\ncompose the disease; the cure will consist of a series of\\npartial destructions, in which psychological attack and\\nphysical intervention are juxtaposed, complement each\\nother, but never interpenetrate,\\n\\nIn fact, what to us seems already the outline of a psychological cure was no such thing to the classical physicians\\nwho applied it. Since the Renaissance, music had regained\\nall those therapeutic virtues antiquity had attributed to it.\\nIts effects were especially remarkable upon madness. Johann Schenck cured a man “fallen into a profound melancholia” by having him attend “concerts of musical instruments that particularly pleased him”; Wilhelm Albrecht\\nalso cured a delirious patient, after having tried all other\\nremedies in vain, by prescribing’ the performance, during\\none of his attacks, of “a little song which awakened the\\nsufferer, pleased him, excited him to laugh, and dispelled\\nthe paroxysm forever.” Even cases of frenzy were cited as\\nhaving been cured by music. Now, such observations were\\nnever meant to suggest psychological interpretations. If\\n\\n(178)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Doctors and Patients\\n\\nmusic cured, it was by acting upon the entire human being,\\nby penetrating the body as directly, as éfficaciously as it did\\nthe soul: did not Diemerbroek know of people stricken\\nwith the plague who had been cured by music? Doubtless\\nmost people no longer believed, as Giambattista della Porta\\nstill did, that music, in the material reality of its sounds,\\nafforded the body the secret virtues hidden in the very\\nsubstance of the instruments; no longer believed, as he did,\\nthat lymphatics were cured by “a lively air played on a\\nholly flute,” or that melancholics were soothed by “a soft\\nair played on a hellebore flute,” or that it was necessary to\\nuse “‘a flute made of larkspur or iris stems to cure impotent\\nand frigid men.” But if music no longer transmitted the\\nvirtues sealed in substances, it was efficacious upon the\\nbody because of the qualities it imposed upon it. Ic even\\nconstituted the most rigorous of all the mechanisms of quality, since at its origin it was nothing but movement,\\nwhereas once it had reached the ear it immediately became\\nqualitative effect. Music’s therapeutic value occurred because this transformation was undone in the body, quality\\nthere re-decomposed into movements, the pleasure of sensation became what it had always been: regular vibrations\\nand equilibrium of tensions. Man, as unity of soul and\\nbody, followed the cycle of harmony in a reverse direction,\\nredescending from the harmonious to the harmonic. In him,\\nmusic was decomposed, but health restored. But there was\\nanother avenue, still more direct and more efficacious: by\\ntaking it, man no longer played the negative role of antiinstrument; he reacted as if he himself were the instrument:\\n“If one were to consider the human body as merely an\\nassemblage of more or less taut fibers, ignoring their sensibility, their life, their movement, one would easily conceive\\nthat music must produce the same effect on the fibers as it\\ndoes on the strings of similar instruments;”\" an effect of\\nresonance which has no need to follow the long and com\\n(779)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Mavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nplex paths of auditory sensation. The nervous system’ vibrates with the music that fills the air; the fibers are like so\\nmany “deaf dancers” whose movement keeps time to a\\nmusic they do not hear. And this time, it is within the body\\nitself, from the nervous fiber to the soul, that the music is\\nrecomposed, the harmonic structure of consonance restoring the harmonious functioning of the passions.\\n\\nThe very use of passion in the therapeutics of madness\\nmust not be understood as a form of psychological medication. To employ passion against dementia is merely to attack the unity of soul and body at its most rigorous point,\\nto utilize an event in the double system of its effects, and in\\nthe immediate correspondence of their meaning. To cure\\nmadness by passion implies that one accepts the reciprocal\\nsymbolism of soul and body. Fear, in the eighteenth century, was regarded as one of the passions most advisable to\\narouse in madmen. It was considered the natural complement of the constraints imposed upon maniacs and lunatics;\\na sort of discipline was even imagined which would immediately accompany and compensate every attack of anger\\nin 2 maniac by a reaction of fear: “It is by force that the\\nfuries of a maniac are overcome; it is by opposing fear to\\nanger that anger may be mastered. If the terror of punishment and public shame are associated in the mind during\\nattacks of anger, one will not appear without the other; the\\npoison and the antidote are inseparable.”*? But fear is\\nefficacious not only at the level of the effects of the disease;\\nit is the disease itself that fear attacks and suppresses. It has,\\nin fact, the property of petrifying the operations of the\\nNervous system, somehow congealing its too mobile fibers,\\ncontrolling all their disordered movements; “fear being a\\npassion that diminishes the excitation of the brain, it can\\nconsequently calm its excesses, and especially the irascible\\nexcitation of maniacs,”*\\n\\n(780)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Doctors and Patients\\n\\nIf the fear-anger antithesis is efficacious against manic\\nirritation, it can be used inversely against the unmotivated\\nfears of melancholics, hypochondriacs, and all those who\\nhave a lymphatic temperament. Tissot, reviving the traditional idea that anger is a discharge of bile, considers that it\\nis useful for dissolving the phlegms amassed in the stomach\\nand in the blood. By subjecting the nervous fibers to a\\nstronger tension, anger gives them more vigor, thus restoring their lost elasticity and permitting fear to disappear.\\nThe cure by passion is based on a constant metaphor of\\nqualities and movements; it always implies thar they are\\nimmediately transferable in their own modality from the\\nbody to the soul, and vice versa. It must be used, says\\nScheidenmantel in the treatise he devotes to this form of\\ncure, “when the cure necessitates in the body changes\\nidentical to those which this passion produces.” And it is\\nin this sense that it can be the universal substitute for all\\nother physical therapeutics; it is only another way to pro~\\nduce the same sequence of effects. Between a cure by the\\npassions and a cure by the prescriptions of the pharmacopoeia, there is no difference in nature; but only a diversity\\nin the mode of access to those mechanisms which are com~mon to the body and to the soul. “The passions must be\\nutilized, if the sufferer cannot be led by reason to do what\\nis necessary for the restoration of his health.”\\n\\nIt is thus not possible to use as a valid or at least meaningful distinction for the classical period the difference—immediately apparent to us—between physical medications\\nand psychological or moral medications. The difference\\nonly begins to exist in all its profundity the day when fear\\nis no Jonger used as a method for arresting movement, but\\nas a punishment; when joy does not signify organic expansion, but reward; when anger is nothing more than a response to concerted humiliation; in short, when the nine\\nC282)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Mavoness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nteenth century, by inventing its famous “moral methods,”\\nhas brought madness and its cure into the domain of guilt,\\nThe distinction between the physical and the moral becomes a practical concept in the medicine of the mind\\nonly when the problematics of madness shifts to an interrogation of the subject responsible. The purely moral\\nspace, which is then defined, gives the exact measurements\\nof that psychological inwardness where modern man seeks\\nboth his depth and his truth. Physical therapeutics tends to\\nbecome, in the first half of the nineteenth century, a cure\\ndevised by an innocent determinism, and moral treatment a\\ncure wrought by a culpable freedom. Psychology, as a\\nmeans of curing, is henceforth organized around punishment. Before seeking to relieve, ic inflicts suffering within\\nthe rigor of a moral necessity. “Do not employ consolations, they are useless; have no recourse to reasoning, it\\ndoes not persuade; do not be sad with melancholics, your\\nsadness sustains theirs; do not assume an air of gaiety with\\nthem, they are only hurt by it. What is required is great\\nsang-froid, and when necessary, severity. Let your reason\\nbe their rule of conduct. A single string still vibrates in\\nthem, that of pain; have courage enough to pluck it.”\"*\\nThe heterogeneity of the physical and the moral in medical thought is not a result of Descartes’s definition of substances; 2 century and a half of post-Cartesian medicine did\\nnot succeed in assimilating that separation on the level of\\nproblems and methods, nor in understanding the distinction\\nof substances as an opposition of organic to psychological.\\nCartesian or anti-Cartesian, classical medicine never introduced Descartes’s metaphysical dualism into anthropology.\\nAnd when the separation did occur, it was not by a renewed loyalty to the Meditations, but by a new privilege\\naccorded to transgression. Only the use of punishment distinguished, in treating the mad, the medications of the\\nbody from those of the soul. A purely psychological medi\\n(282)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nDoctors and Patients\\n\\ncine was made possible only when madness was alienated in\\nguilt.\\n\\nOf this, however, a whole aspect of medical practice during the classical period might stand as a long denial. The\\npsychological element, in its purity, seems to have its place\\namong the techniques. How else explain the importance\\nattached to exhortation, to persuasion, to reasoning, to that\\nwhole dialogue in which the classical physician engages\\nwith his patient, independently of the cure by bodily remedies? How explain that Sauvages can write, in agreement\\nwith all his contemporaries: “One must be a philosopher to\\nbe able to cure the diseases of the soul. For as the origin of\\nthese diseases is nothing more than a violent desire for a\\nthing which the sufferer envisages as a good, it is part of the\\nphysician’s duty to prove to him by solid reasons that what\\nhe desires so ardently is an apparent good but a real evil, in\\norder to make him renounce his error.”\\n\\nIn fact this approach to madness is neither more nor less\\npsychological than any of those we have already discussed.\\nLanguage, the formulations of truth or morality, are in\\ndirect contact with the body; and it is Bienville again, in his\\ntreatise on N-ymphomania, who shows how the adoption or\\nthe rejection of an ethical principle can directly modify the\\ncourse of organic processes. However, there is a difference\\nin nature between those techniques which consist in modifying the qualities common to body and soul, and those\\nwhich consist in treating madness by discourse. In the first\\ncase, the technique is one of metaphors, at the level of a\\ndisease that is a deterioration of nature; in the second, the\\ntechnique is one of language, at the level of a madness perceived as reason’s debate with itself. The technique, in this\\nlast form, functions in a domain where madness is “treated”\\n-~in all the senses of the word—in terms of truth and error.\\nIn short, there always existed, throughout the classical\\n\\n(183)\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nManness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nperiod, a juxtaposition of two technical universes in the\\ntherapeutics of madness. One, which is based on an implicir\\nmechanics of qualities, and which addresses madness as es~\\nsentially passion—that is, a certain compound (movementquality) belonging to both body and soul; the other, which\\nis based on the discursive movement of reason reasoning\\nwith itself, and which addresses madness as error, as double\\ninanity of language and image, as delirium. The structural\\ncycle of passion and of delirium which constitutes the classical experience of madness reappears here in the world of\\ntechniques—but in a syncopated form. Its unity is expressed only distantly. What is immediately visible, in capital letters, is the duality, almost the opposition, in the medicine of madness, of the methods of suppressing the disease,\\nand of the forms of treating unreason. These latter can be\\nreduced to three essential configurations.\\n\\n1, Awakening. Since delirium is the dream of waking\\npersons, those who are delirious must be torn from this\\nquasi-sleep, recalled from their waking dream and its images to an authentic awakening, where the dream disappears before the images of perception. Descartes sought this\\nabsolute awakening, which dismisses one by one all the\\nforms of illusion, at the beginning of his Meditations, and\\nfound it, paradoxically, in the very awareness of the dream,\\nin the consciousness of deluded consciousness. But in madmen, it is medicine which must effect the awakening, transforming the solitude of Cartesian courage into an authoritarian intervention, by the man awake and certain of his\\nwakefulness, into the illusion of the man who sleeps waking: a short cut that dogmatically reduces Descartes’s long\\nroad. What Descartes discovers at the end of his resolution\\nand in the doubling of a consciousness that never separates\\nfrom itself and does not split, medicine imposes from outside, and in the dissociation of doctor and patient.

On February\\n20, 1672, Louis XIV assigned to the Orders of Saint-Lazare\\nand Mont-Carmel the effects of all the military and hospital\\norders; they were entrusted with the administration of the\\nlazar houses of the kingdom. Some twenty years later, the\\nedict of 1672 was revoked, and by a series of staggered\\nmeasures from March 1693 to July 1695 the goods of the\\nlazar houses were thenceforth assigned to other hospitals\\nand welfare establishments. The few lepers scattered in the\\n1,200 still-existing houses were collected at Saint-Mesmin\\nnear Orléans. These decrees were first applied in Paris,\\nwhere the Parlement transferred the revenue in question to\\nthe establishments of the Hépital Général; this example was\\nimitated by the provincial authorities; Toulouse transferred\\nthe effects of its lazar houses to the Hépital des Incurables\\n(1696); those of Beaulieu in Normandy went to the HételDicu in Caen; those of Voley were assigned to the Hopital\\nde Sainte-Foy. Only Saint-Mesmin and the wards of Ganets, near Bordeaux, remained as a reminder.\\n\\nEngland and Scotland alone had opened 220 lazar houses\\nfor a million and a half inhabitants in the twelfth century.\\nBut as early as the fourteenth century they began to empty\\nout; by the time Edward III ordered an inquiry into the\\nhospital of Ripon—in 1342—there were no more lepers; he\\nassigned the institution’s effects to the poor. At the end of\\nthe twelfth century, Archbishop Puisel had founded a\\nhospital in which by 1434 only two beds were reserved for\\nlepers, should any be found. In 1348, the great leprosarium\\nof Saint Albans contained only three patients; the hospital\\nof Romenal in Kent was abandoned twenty-four years\\nlater, for lack of lepers. At Chatham, the lazar house of\\nSaint Bartholomew, established in 1078, had been one of\\nthe most important in England; under Elizabeth, it cared\\nfor only two patients; it was finally closed in 1627.\\n\\nThe same regression of leprosy occurred in Germany,\\nperhaps a little more slowly; and the same conversion of\\n\\n(5)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Doctors and Patients\\n\\nment of the Cogito in relation to the time of the dream, of\\nillusion, and of madness. A completely exterior Cogito,\\nalien to cogitation itself, and which can be imposed upon it\\nonly in the form of an invasion.\\n\\nThis structure of invasion by wakefulness is one of the\\nmost constant forms among the therapeutics of madness. It\\noften assumes the simplest aspects, simultaneously those\\nmost highly charged with images and those most credited\\nwith immediate powers. It is asserted that 2 gun discharged\\nnear her cured a young girl of convulsions contracted as\\nthe result of severe grief. Without going so far as this iconographic representation of the methods of awakening, sudden and strong emoti: ns achieve the same result. It is in this\\nspirit that Boerhaave performed his famous cure of convulsives at Haarlem. In the city hospiral, an epidemic of\\nconvulsions had broken out. Antispasmodics, administered\\nin strong doses, did no good. Boerhaave ordered “that\\nstoves filled with burning coals be brought, and that iron\\nhooks of a certain form be heated in them; thereupon, he\\nsaid m a loud voice that since all the means hitherto employed in attempting to cure the convulsions had been useless, he knew of only one other remedy, which was to bum\\nto the bone, with red-hot irons, a certain spot on the arm of\\nany person, male or female, who suffered an attack of a\\nconvulsive illness.”**\\n\\nSlower, but also more certain of the truth it confronts, is\\nthe awakening that proceeds from wisdom itself and from\\nits insistent, imperative progress through the landscapes of\\nmadness, From this wisdom, in its various forms, Willis\\nsought the cure of the various madnesses. For imbeciles, a\\npedagogical wisdom; an “attentive and devoted master\\nmust educate them completely”; they must be taught, little\\nby little and very slowly, what children are taught in\\nschool. For melancholics, a wisdom that takes as its model\\nthe most rigorous and most evident forms of trath: what is\\n\\n(18s)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nimaginary in their delirium will disappear in the light of an\\nincontestable truth; this is why “mathematical and chemical” studies are strongly recommended. For the others, the\\nwisdom of a well-ordered life will reduce their delirium;\\nthere is no need to impose upon them any other truth than\\nthat of their everyday life; remaining in their homes, “they\\nmust continue to manage their affairs, direct their families,\\norder and cultivate their estates, their gardens, their orchards, their fields.” It is, on the contrary, the exactitude of\\na social order, imposed from without and, if necessary, by\\nforce, that can gradually restore the minds of maniacs to\\nthe light of truth: “For this, the insane person, placed in a\\nspecial house, will be treated, either by the doctor or by\\ntrained assistants, in such a way that he may be always\\nmaintained in his duty, in his appearance and habits, by\\nwarnings, by remonstrances, and by punishments immediately inflicted.”**\\n\\nLittle by little during the classical period, this authoritarian awakening of madness would lose its original meaning and limit itself to being no more than recollection of\\nmoral Jaw, return to the good, fidelity to the law. What\\nWillis still intended as a reintroduction to troth would no\\nlonger be entirely understood by Sauvages, who speaks of\\nlucidity in the recognition of the good: “Thus, one can\\nrecall to reason those whom false principles of moral philosophy have caused to lose their own, as long as they are\\nwilling to examine with us what is truly good, and what\\nthings are to be preferred to others.” Already it is no\\nlonger as awakener that the physician is to function, but as\\nmoralist. Against madness, Tissot considers that “a pure\\nconscience, without reproach, is an excellent preservative.”\\nAnd soon comes Pinel, for whom the awakening to truth\\nno longer has a meaning in the cure, but only obedience\\nand blind submission: “A fundamental principle for the\\ncure of mania in a great number of cases is to resort first of\\n\\n(286)\\n\\x0c  \\n\\nDoctors and Patients\\n\\nall to an energetic repression, and to proceed subsequently\\nto methods of benevolence.”\\n\\n2. Theatrical Representation. In appearance at least,\\nthis is a technique rigorously opposed to that of awakening.\\nThere, delirium, in all its immediate vivacity, ‘was confronted by the patient work of reason. Either in the form\\nof a slow pedagogy, or the form of an authoritarian invasion, reason was imposed, as if by the weight of its own\\nbeing. The non-being of madness, the inanity of error, was\\nforced to yield, finally, to this pressure of the truch. Here,\\nthe therapeutic operation functions entirely in the space of\\nthe imagination; we are dealing with a complicity of the\\nunreal with itself; the i imagination must play its own game,\\nvoluntarily propose new images, espouse delirium for delirium’s sake, and without opposition or confrontation,\\nwithout even a visible dialectic, must, paradoxically, cure,\\nHealth must lay siege to madness and conquer it in the very\\nnothingness in which the disease is imprisoned, When the\\nimagination “tis sick, it can be cured only by the effect of a\\nhealthy and active imagination. . . . Ic is all one whether\\nthe invalid’s imagination is cured by fear, by a strong and\\npainful impression upon the senses, or by an illusion.”\\nIllusion can cure the illusory—while reason alone can free\\nfrom the unreasonable. What then is this dark power of the\\nimaginary?\\n\\nInsofar as it is of the essence of the image to be taken for\\nreality, it is reciprocally characteristic of realiry that it can\\nmime the image, pretend to the same substance, the same\\nsignificance. Without a break, without a jolt, perception\\ncan continue the dream, fill in its gaps, confirm what is\\nprecarious about it, and lead it to its fulfillment. If illusion\\ncan appear as true as perception, perception in its curn can\\nbecome the visible, unchallengeable truth of illusion. Such\\nis the first step of the cure by “theatrical representation”:\\nto integrate the unreality of the image into perceived truth,\\n\\n(787)\\n\\n  \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nManvness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nwithout the Jatter seeming to contradict or even contest the\\nformer. Thus Zacatus Lusitanus describes the cure of a\\nmelancholic who believed himself damned while still on\\nearth because of the enormity of the sins he had committed.\\nIn the impossibility of convincing him by reasonable arguments that he could be saved, his physicians accepted his\\ndelirium and caused an “angel” dressed in white, with a\\nsword in its hand, to appear co him, and after a severe\\nexhortation this delusive vision announced that his sins had\\nbeen remitted.\\n\\nFrom this very example, we see the next step: representation within the #mage is not enough, it is also necessary to\\ncontinue the delirious discourse. For in the patient\\'s insane\\nwords there is a voice that speaks; it obeys its own grammar, it articulates a meaning. Grammar and meaning must\\nbe maintained in such a way that the representation of the\\nhallucination in reality does not seem like the transition\\nfrom one register to another, like a translation into a new\\nlanguage, with an altered meaning. The same language\\nmust continue to make itself understood, merely bringing a\\nnew deductive element to the rigor of its discourse. Yet this\\nelement is not indifferent; the problem is not to pursue the\\ndelirium, but by continuing it to bring it to an end. Ic must\\nbe led to a state of paroxysm and crisis in which, without\\nany addition of a foreign element, it is confronted by itself\\nand forced to argue against the demands of its own truth.\\nThe real and perceptual discourse that prolongs the delirious language of the images must therefore, without\\nescaping the latter’s laws, without departing from its sovereignty, exercise a positive function in relation to it; it tightens that language around its essential element; if it\\nTepresents it at the risk of confirming it, it is in order to\\ndramatize it. The case is cited of a sufferer who thought\\nthat he was dead, and was really dying from not eating; “a\\ngroup of people who had made themselves pale and were\\n\\n(288)\\n\\x0c Doctors and Patients\\n\\ndressed like the dead, entered his room, set up a table,\\nbrought food, and began to eat and drink before the bed.\\nThe starving ‘dead man’ looked at them; they were astonished that he stayed in bed; they persuaded him that dead\\npeople eat at least as much as living ones. He readily accommodated himself to this idea.””* It is within a continuous discourse that the elements of delirium, coming into\\ncontradiction, bring on the crisis. A crisis which is, in a\\nvery ambiguous manner, both medical and theatrical, a\\nwhole tradition of Western medicine dating from Hippocrates here intersects, suddenly and for only a few years,\\nwith one of the major forms of theatrical experience.\\nBefore us appears the great theme of a crisis that confronts\\nthe madman with his own meaning, reason with unreason,\\nman’s lucid ruse with the blindness of the lunatic—a crisis\\nwhich marks the point at which illusion, turned back upon\\nitself, will open to the dazzlement of truth.\\n\\nThis opening is imminent in the crisis; in fact it is this\\nopening, with its immediate proximity, that constitutes the\\nessential element of the crisis. But the opening does not\\nresult from the crisis itself. In order for the crisis to be\\nmedical and not simply dramatic, in order for it to be not\\nan annihilation of the man, but simply a suppression of the\\ndisease; in short, in order for the dramatic representation of\\nthe delirium to have an effect of comic purification, a ruse\\nmust be introduced at 2 given moment. A ruse, or at least\\nan element which surreptitiously alters the autonomous\\noperation of the delirium, and which, ceaselessly confirming it, does not bind it to its own truth without at the same\\ntime linking it to the necessity for its own suppression. The\\nsimplest example of this method is the ruse employed with\\ndelirious patients who imagine they perceive within their\\nbodies an object or an extraordinary animal: “When an\\ninvalid believes that he has a living animal shut up within\\nhis body, one must pretend to have withdrawn it; if ic is in\\n\\n(789)\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\x0c Manvness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nthe stomach, one may, by means of a powerful purge, produce this effect, throwing such an animal into the basin\\nwithout the patient’s noticing.”\"* The theatrical device\\nrepresents the object of the delirium bute cannot do so\\nwithout externalizing it, and if it gives the invalid a perceptual confirmation of his illusion, it does so only while ridding him of it by force. The artificial reconstitution of\\ndelirium constitutes the real distance in which the sufferer\\nrecovers his liberty.\\n\\nBut sometimes, there is even no need of this “distancing.”\\nIt is within the quasi-perception of the delirium that there\\nis established, by means of a ruse, a perceptual element,\\nsilent at first, but whose gradual affirmacion will come to\\ncontest the entire system. It is in himself and in the perception which confirms his delirium that the sufferer perceives\\nthe liberating reality. Trallion reports how a physician dissipated the delirium of a melancholic who imagined he had\\nno head, but only a kind of void in its place; the physician,\\nentering into the delirium, agreed at the sufferer’s request to\\nfill up this space, and placed upon his head a great bail of\\nlead. Soon the discomfort that resulted from the painful\\nweight convinced the invalid that he had a head. Uldmately the ruse and its function of comic reduction can be\\nassured, with the complicity of the physician but without\\nany other direct intervention on his part, by the spontaneous reaction of the sufferer’s organism. In the case cited\\nabove of the melancholic who was really dying because he\\nwould not eat, believing himself already dead, the theatrical\\nrepresentation of a dead men’s banquet incited him to eat;\\nthis nourishment restored him, “the consumption of food\\nmade him quieter,” and the organic disorder thus disappearing, the delirium which was indissociably cause and effect\\ndisappeared forthwith. Thus the real death that would have\\nresulted from the imaginary death was avoided by reality,\\nby the mere representation of unreal death. The exchange\\n\\n(790)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Doctors and Patients\\n\\nof non-being with itself is carried out in this ingenious\\nplay: the non-being of delirium is rurned against the being\\nof the illness, and suppresses it by the simple fact that it is\\ndriven out of the delirium by dramatic representation. The\\nfulfillment of delirium’s non-being in being is able to suppress it as non-being itself; and this by the pure mechanism\\nof its internal contradiction—a mechanism that is both a\\nplay on words and a play of illusion, games of language and\\nof the image; the delirium, in effect, is suppressed as nonbeing since it becomes a perceived form of being; but since\\nthe being of delirium is entirely in its non-being, it is suppressed as delirium, And its confirmation in theatrical fantasy restores it to a truth which, by holding it captive in\\nreality, drives it out of reality itself, and makes it disappear\\nin the non-delirious discourse of reason. ,\\n3The Return to the Immediate. Since madness is illusion, the cure of madness, if it is true that such a cure can\\nbe effected by theater, can also and still more directly be\\neffected by the suppression of theater. To entrust madness\\nand its empty world directly to the plenitude of a nature\\nwhich does not deceive because its immediacy does not acknowledge non-being, is to deliver madness both to its own\\ntruth (since madness, as a disease, is after all only a natural\\nbeing), and to its closest contradiction (since delirium, as\\nappearance without content, is the very contrary of the\\noften secret and invisible wealth of nature). This contradiction thus appears as the reason of unreason, in a double\\nsense: it withholds unreason’s causes, and at the same time\\nconceals the principle of its suppression. It must be noted,\\nhowever, that these themes are not contemporary with the\\nclassical period for its entire duration. Although they are\\norganized around the same experience of unreason, they\\nfollow after the themes of theatrical representation; and\\ntheir appearance marks the moment when the debate on\\nbeing and illusion begins to yield to a problematics of na\\n(797)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Mavoness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\ntare. Games of theatrical illusion lose their meaning, and\\nthe artificial techniques of iconographic representation are\\nreplaced by the simple and confident act of a natural reduction, And this in an ambiguous direction, since it is as\\nouch a question of reduction by nature as of a reduction to\\nnature.\\n\\nThe return to the immediate is the therapeutics par excellence, because it is the rigorous refusal of therapeutics: it\\ncures insofar as it is a disregard of all cures. It is in man’s\\npassivity with regard to himself, in the silence he imposes\\non his art and his artifices, that nature engages in an activity\\nwhich is exactly reciprocal to renunciation. For, to consider it more closely, this passivity of man is real activity;\\nwhen man entrusts himself to medicine, he escapes the law\\nof labor that nature itself imposes on him; he sinks into the\\nworld of artifice, and of anri-nature, of which his madness\\nis only one of the manifestations; it is by ignoring this disease and resuming his place in the activity of natural beings\\nthat man in an apparent passivity (which is in fact only an\\nindustrious fidelity) succeeds in being cured. Thus Bernadin de Saint-Pierre explains how he cured himself of 2\\n“strange disease,” in which, “like Oedipus, he saw two\\nsuns.” Medicine had offered him its succor, and had informed him that “the seat of his disease was in the nerves.”\\nIn vain he applied the most highly prized medicaments; he\\nsoon noticed that the physicians themselves were killed by\\ntheir own remedies: “Te was to Jean-Jacques Rousseau that\\nI owed my return to health. I had read, in his immortal\\nwritings, among other natural truths, that man is made to\\nwork, not to meditate, Until that time I had exercised my\\nsoul and rested my body; I changed my ways; I exercised\\nmy body and rested my soul. I gave up most books; I\\nturned my eyes to the works of nature, which addressed\\nall my senses in a language that neither time nor nations can\\ncorrupt. My history and my newspapers were the plants of\\n\\n(192)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Doctors and Patients\\n\\nthe field and forest; it was not my thoughts that struggled\\nto them, as in the system of men, but their thoughts that\\ncame to me in a thousand agreeable shapes.””\\n\\nDespite the formulations of it which certain disciples of\\nRousseau managed to propose, this return to the immediate\\nwas neither absolute nor simple. For madness, even if it is\\nprovoked or sustained by what is most artificial in society,\\nappears, in its violent forms, as the savage expression of the\\nmost primitive human desires. Madness in the classical period, as we have seen, is rooted in the threats of bestialiry—\\na bestiality completely dominated by predatory and murderous instincts. To entrust madness to nature would be,\\nby an uncontrolled reversal, to abandon it to that fury of\\nanti-nature. The cure of madness thus supposes a return to\\nwhat is immediate, not in relation to desire, but in relation\\nto the imagination—a return that dismisses from man’s life\\nand pleasures everything that is artificial, unreal, imaginary.\\nThe therapeutics, by the reflective plunge into the immediate, secretly supposes the mediation of a wisdom which\\ndistinguishes, in nature, between what derives from vio~\\nlence and what derives from truth. This is the whole difference between the Savage and the Laborer. “Savages . . .\\nfead the life of a carnivorous animal rather than that of a\\nreasonable being”; the life of the Laborer, on the other\\nhand, “is in fact happier than that of the man of the\\nworld.” On the savage’s side, immediate desire, without\\ndiscipline, without constraint, without real morality; on the\\nlaborer’s side, pleasure without mediation, in other words,\\nwithout vain stimulus, without provocation or imaginary\\nachievement. What, in nature and its immediate virmes,\\ncures madness is pleasure—but a pleasure that on one hand\\nmakes desire vain without even having to repress it, since it\\noffers a plenitude of satisfaction in advance, and on the\\nother makes imagination absurd, since it spontaneously\\ncontributes the happy presence of reality. “Pleasures enter\\n\\n(793)\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\x0c Manpness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\ninto the eternal order of things; they exist invariably; certain conditions are necessary to form them .. . ; these\\nconditions are not arbitrary; nature has formed them; imagination cannot create, and the man most devoted to pleasures can increase them only by renouncing all those which\\ndo not bear this stamp of nature.”** The immediate world\\nof the laborer is thus a world suffused with wisdom and\\nmeasure, which cures madness insofar as it renders desire\\nuseless, along with the movements of passion desire gives\\nrise to, and also insofar as it reduces along with the imaginary all the possibilities of delirium, What Tissot understands by “pleasure” is this immediate curative agent, liberated from both passion and language: that is, from the two\\ngreat forms of human experience that give birth to unreason.\\n\\nAnd perhaps nature, as the concrete form of the immediate, has an even more fundamental power in the suppression\\nof madness, For it has the power of freeing man from his\\nfreedom. In narure—that nature, at least, which is measured\\nby the double exclusion of the violence of desire and the\\nunreality of hallucination—man is doubtless liberated from\\nsocial constraints (those which force him “to calculate and\\ndraw up the balance sheet of his imaginary pleasures which\\nbear that name but are none”) and from the uncontrollable\\nmovement of the passions. But by that very fact, he is\\ngently and as it were internally bound by a system of nataral obligations. The pressures of the healthiest needs, the\\nrhythm of the days and the seasons, the calm necessity to\\nfeed and shelter oneself, constrain the disorder of madmen\\nto a regular observance. The excessively remote inventions\\nof the imagination are dismissed, along with the excessively\\nurgent disguises of desire. In the gentleness of a pleasure\\nthat does not constrain, man is linked to the wisdom of\\nnature, and this fidelity in the form of freedom dissipates\\nthe unreason which juxtaposes in its paradox the extreme\\n\\n(194)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavNESS & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nthe lazar houses, hastened by the Reformation, which left\\nmunicipal administrations in charge of welfare and hospital\\nestablishments; this was the case in Leipzig, in Munich, in\\nHamburg. In 1542, the effects of the lazar houses of Schleswig-Holstein were transferred to the hospitals. In Stuttgart\\na magistrate’s report of 1589 indicates that for fifty years\\nalready there had been no lepers in the house provided for\\nthem. At Lipplingen, the lazar house was soon peopled\\nwith incurables and madmen.\\n\\nA strange disappearance, which was doubtless not the\\nlong-sought effect of obscure medical practices, but the\\nspontaneous result of segregation and also the consequence,\\nafter the Crusades, of the break with the Eastern sources of\\ninfection. Leprosy withdrew, leaving derelict these low\\nplaces and these rites which were intended, not to suppress\\nit, but to keep it at a sacred distance, to fix it in an inverse\\nexaltation. What doubtless remained longer ‘than leprosy,\\nand would persist when the lazar houses had been empty\\nfor years, were the values and images attached to the figure\\nof the leper as well as the meaning of his exclusion, the\\nsocial importance of that insistent and fearful figure which\\nwas not driven off without first being inscribed within a\\nsacred circle.\\n\\nIf the leper was removed from the world, and from the\\ncommunity of the Church visible, his existence was yet a\\nconstant manifestation of God, since it was a sign both of\\nHis anger and of His grace: “My friend,” says the ritual of\\nthe Church of Vienne, “it pleaseth Our Lord that thou\\nshouldst be infected with this malady, and thou hast great\\ngrace at the hands of Our Lord that he desireth to punish\\nthee for thy iniquities in this world.” And at the very\\nmoment when the priest and his assistants drag him out of\\nthe church with backward step, the leper is assured that he\\nstill bears witness for God: “And howsoever thou mayest\\nbe apart from the Church and the company of the Sound,\\nyet art thou not apart from the grace of God.” Brueghel’s\\n\\n(6)\\n\\x0c  \\n\\nDoctors and Patients\\n\\ndeterminism of passion and the extreme fantasy of the\\nimage. Thus one begins to dream, in these mingled landscapes of ethics and medicine, of a liberation from madness:\\na liberation that must not be understood in its origin as the\\ndiscovery, by philanthropy, of the humanity of madmen,\\nbut as a desire to open madness to the gentle constraints of\\nnature.\\n\\nThe old village of Gheel which, from the end of the\\nMiddle Ages, still bore witness to the now forgotten relation between the confinement of madmen and the exclusion\\nof lepers, also received in the last years of the eighteenth\\ncentury a sudden reinterpretation. What had once marked,\\nhere, the entire violent, pathetic separation of the world of\\nmadmen from the world of men, now conveyed the idyllic\\nvalues of a rediscovered unity of unreason and nature. This\\nvillage had once signified that madmen were confined, and\\nthat therefore the man of reason was protected from them;\\nnow it manifested that the madman was liberated, and that,\\n\" in this liberty which put him on a level with the laws of\\nnature, he was reconciled with the man of reason, At\\nGheel, according to Jouy’s description of it, “four-fifths of\\nthe inhabitants are mad, but mad in the full sense of the\\nword, and they enjoy without restraint the same freedom\\nas the other citizens... . Healthful food, pure air, all the devices of liberty: such is the regimen prescribed for them,\\nand to which the greatest number, by the end of a year,\\nowe their cure.” Without anything in the instirutions having as yet really changed, the meaning of exclusion and of\\nconfinement begins to alter: it slowly assumes positive values, and the neutral, empty, nocturnal space in which unreason was formerly restored to its nothingness begins to be\\npeopled by a nature to which madness, liberated, is obliged\\nto submit. Confinement, as the separation of reason from\\nunreason, is not suppressed; but at the very heart of its\\nintention, the space it occupies reveals natural powers,\\n\\n(19s)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nManvness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nmore constraining for madness, more likely to subjugate it\\nin its essence, than the whole of the old limiting and repressive system. Madness must be liberated from that system so that, in the space of confinement, now endowed\\nwith a positive efficacity, it will be free to slough off its\\nsavage freedom, and to welcome the demands of nature\\nthat are for it both cruth and law. Insofar as it is law, nature\\nconstrains the violence of desire; insofar as it is truth, it\\nreduces anti-nature, and all the hallucinations of the imag\\ninary.\\n\\nHere is how Pinel describes that nature, speaking of the\\nhospital of Saragossa: there has been established here “a\\nsort of counterpoise to the mind’s extravagances by the\\nattraction and the charm inspired by the cultivation of\\nthe fields, by the natural instinct that leads man to sow the\\nearth and thus to satisfy his needs by the fruit of his labors.\\nFrom morning on, you can see them . . . leaving gaily for\\nthe various parts of a vast enclosure that belongs to the\\nhospital, sharing with a sort of emulation the tasks appropriate to the seasons, cultivating wheat, vegetables, con~\\ncerned in turn with the harvest, with trellises, with the\\nvintage, with olive picking, and finding in the evening, in\\ntheir solitary asylum, calm and quiet sleep. The most constant experience has indicated, in this hospital, that this is\\nthe surest and most efficacious way to restore man to reason.”* Beneath the conventional images, the rigor of a\\nmeaning is easily perceived. The return to the immediate is\\neffective against unreason only insofar as the immediate is\\ncontrolled—and divided against itself; an immediate in\\nwhich violence is isolated from truth, savagery separated\\nfrom liberty, in which nature can no longer recognize itself\\nin the fantastic figures of anti-nature. In short, an immediate in which nature is mediatized by morality. In a space so\\narranged, madness will never again be able to speak the\\nlanguage of unreason, with ali that in it transcends the\\n\\n(196)\\n\\x0c Doctors and Patients\\n\\nnatural phenomena of disease. It will be entirely enclosed in\\na pathology. A transformation which later periods have\\nreceived as a positive acquisition, the accession, if not of a\\ntruth, at least of what would make the recognition of truth\\npossible; but which in the eyes of history must appear as\\nwhat it was: that is, the reduction of the classical experience of unreason to a strictly moral perception of madness,\\nwhich would secretly serve as a nucleus for all the concepts\\nthat the nineteenth century would subsequently vindicate\\nas scientific, positive, and experimental.\\n\\nThis metamorphosis, which occurred in the second half\\nof the eighteenth century, was initiated in the techniques of\\ncure. But it very quickly appeared more generally, winning\\nover the minds of reformers, guiding the great reorganization of the experience of madness in the last years of the\\ncentury. Very soon Pinel could write: “How necessary it\\nis, in order to forestall hypochondria, melancholia, or mahia, to follow the immutable laws of morality!”\\n\\nIn the classical period, it is futile to try to distinguish\\nphysical therapeutics from psychological medications, for\\nthe simple reason that psychology did not exist. When the\\nconsumption of bitters was prescribed, for example, it was\\nnot a question of physical treatment, since it was the soul as\\nwell as the body that was to be scoured; when the simple\\nlife of a laborer was prescribed for a melancholic, when the\\ncomedy of his delirium was acted out before him, this was\\nnot a psychological intervention, since the movement of\\nthe spirits in the nerves, the density of the humors were\\nprincipally involved. But in the first case, we are dealing\\nwith an art of the transformation of qualities, a technique\\nin which the essence of madness is taken as nature, and as\\ndisease; in the second, we are dealing with an art of discourse, and of the restitution of truth, in which madness is\\nsignificant as unreason.\\n\\n(797)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Manvness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nWhen, in the years that followed, this great experience\\nof unreason, whose unity is characteristic of the classical\\nperiod, was dissociated, when madness, entirely confined\\nwithin a moral intuition, was nothing more than disease,\\nthen the distinction we have just established assumed another meaning; what had belonged to disease pertained to\\nthe organic, and what had belonged to unreason, to the\\ntranscendence of its discourse, was relegated to the psychological. And it is precisely here that psychology was born\\n—hot as the truth of madness, but as a sign that madness\\nwas now detached from its truth which was unreason and\\nthat it was henceforth nothing but a phenomenon adrift,\\ninsignificant upon the undefined surface of nature. An\\nenigma without any truth except that which could reduce\\nit.\\n\\nThis is why we must do justice to Freud. Between\\nFreud’s Five Case Histories and Janet’s scrupulous investigations of Psychological Healing, there is more than the\\ndensity of a discovery; there is the sovereign violence of a\\nreturn, Janet enumerated the elements of a division, drew\\nup his inventory, annexed here and there, perhaps conquered. Freud went back to madness at the level of its\\nlanguage, reconstituted one of the essential elements of an\\nexperience reduced to silence by positivism; he did not\\nmake a major addition to the list of psychological treatments for madness; he restored, in medical thought, the\\npossibility of a dialogue with unreason. Let us not be surprised that the most “psychological” of medications has so\\nquickly encountered its converse and its organic confirmations. It is not psychology that is involved in psychoanalysis: but precisely an experience of unreason that it has\\nbeen psychology’s meaning, in the modern world, to mask.\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nTHE GREAT FEAR\\n\\n“One afternoon, I was there, looking 2 great deal, speaking\\nrarely, listening as little as I could, when I was accosted by\\none of the most bizarre persons in this country, where God\\nhas not let them lack. He was a mixture of loftiness, baseness, good sense, and unreason.”\\n\\nIn doubt’s confrontation with its major dangers, Descartes realized that he could not be mad—though he was to\\nacknowledge for a long time to come that all the powers of\\nunreason kept vigil around his thought; but as a philosopher, resolutely undertaking to doubt, he could not be\\n“one of these insane ones.” Rameau’s Nephew, though,\\nknew quite well—and among his fleeting certainties, this\\nwas the most obstinate—that he was mad. “Before beginning, he heaved a profound sigh and raised his hands to his\\nforehead; then he regained his calm demeanor and said to\\nme: you know I am ignorant, mad, impertinent, and\\nlazy.”*\\n\\nThe eighteenth century could not exactly understand\\nthe meaning expressed in Le Neveu de Rameau. Yet some\\n(199)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c   \\n\\n \\n   \\n\\nMaoness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nthing had happened, just when the text was written, which\\npromised a decisive change. A curious thing: the unreason\\nthat had been relegated to the distance of confinement reappeared, fraught with new dangers and as if endowed\\nwith a new power of interrogation. Yet what the cighteenth century first noticed about it was not the secret\\ninterrogation, but only the social effects: the torn clothing,\\nthe arrogance in rags, the tolerated insolence whose disturbing powers were silenced by an amused indulgence.\\nThe eighteenth century might not have recognized itself in\\nRameau’s Nephew, but it was entirely present in the J who\\nserved him as interlocutor and as a type of “exhibitor,”\\namused yet reticent, and with a secret anxiety: for this was\\nthe first time since the Great Confinement that the madman\\nhad become a social individual; ic was the first time that\\nanyone had entered into conversation with him, and that,\\nonce again, he was questioned. Unreason reappeared as 2\\nclassification, which is not much, but it nonetheless reappeared, and slowly recovered its place in the familiarity of\\nthe social landscape. It was there some ten years before the\\nRevolution, when Mercier found it without more astonishment than: “Go into another café; a man whispers to you in\\na calm and confident tone: ‘You cannot imagine, Monsieur,\\nthe Government’s ingratitude toward me, and its blindness\\nto its own interests! For thirty years I have neglected my\\nown affairs; I have shut myself up in my study, meditating,\\ndreaming, calculating; I have devised a project to pay all\\nthe State’s debts; another to enrich the King and assure him\\nan income of 400 million; another to destroy England forever, whose very name affronts me... . When, utterly\\ndevoted to these vast operations that demand all the application of genius, I was distracted by domestic problems,\\nsome nagging creditors kept me in prison for three years.\\n\\n. . But, Monsieur, you see how patriotism is valued—I\\ndie unknown and a martyr for my country.’ \"? At a dis\\n(200)\\n\\x0c  \\n\\n \\n\\nThe Great Fear\\n\\ntance, such persons form a circle around Rameau’s\\nNephew; they do not have his dimensions; it is only in the\\nsearch for the picturesque that they can pass for his epimes.\\nOna yet they are a little more than a social profile, a\\ncaricatural silhouette. There is something inside them that\\nconcerns and touches the unreason of the eighteenth centary. Their chatter, their anxiety, that vague delirium and\\nthat ultimate anguish they experience commonly enough—\\nand in real existences which can still be traced. As with the\\nlibertine, the debauchee, or the ruffian of the end of the\\nseventeenth century, it is difficult to say whether they are\\nmad, sick, or criminal. Mercier himself does not quite know\\nwhat status to give them: “Thus there are in Paris some\\nvery good people, economists and anti-economists, who\\nhave warm hearts, eager for the public good; but unfortunately they have cracked heads; that is, they are shortsighted, they do nor know what century they are in, nor\\nwhat men they are dealing with; more unbearable than\\nidiots, because with pennies and false lights they start from\\nan impossible principle and reason falsely therefrom.”\\nThey really existed, these schemers with “cracked heads,”\\nadding a muffled accompaniment of unreason to the reason\\nof the philosophers, and around those plans for reform,\\nthose constitutions, those projects; the rationality of the\\nEnlightenment found in them a sort of darkened mirror, an\\ninoffensive caricature, But is it not essential that in 2\\nmovement of amused indulgence, a personage of unreason\\nis allowed back into daylight, ac the very moment he was\\nbelieved to be most profoundly hidden in the space of confmement? As if classical reason once again admitted a\\nproximity, a relation, a quasi-resemblance between itself\\nand the images of unreason. As if, ac the moment of its\\ntriumph, reason revived and permitted to drift on the margins of order a character whose mask it had fashioned in\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nManvwess & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nderision—a sort of double in which it both recognized and\\nrevoked itself.\\n\\nYer fear and anxiety were not far off: in the reaction of\\nconfinement, they reappeared, doubled. People were once\\nafraid, people were still afraid, of being confined; at the end\\nof the eighteenth century, Sade was still haunted by fear of\\nwhat he called “the black men” who lay in wait to put him\\naway. But now the estate of confinement acquired its own\\npowers; it became in its turn the birthplace of evil, and\\ncould henceforth spread that evil by itself, insticuting another reign of terror,\\n\\nSuddenly, in a few years in the middle of the eighteenth\\ncentury, a fear arose--a fear formulated in medical terms\\nbut animated, basically, by a moral myth. People were in\\ndread of a mysterious disease that spread, it was said, from\\nthe houses of confinement and would soon threaten the\\ncities. They spoke of prison fevers; they evoked the wag~\\nons of criminals, men in chains who passed through the\\ncities, leaving disease in their wake; scurvy was thought to\\ncause contagions; it was said that the air, tainted by disease,\\nwould corrupt the residential quarters, And the great image\\nof medieval horror reappeared, giving birth, in the metaphors of dread, to a second panic. The house of confinement was no longer only the lazar house at the city’s edge;\\nit was leprosy itself confronting the town: “A terrible ulcer upon the body politic, an ulcer that is wide, deep, and\\ndraining, one that cannot be imagined except by looking\\nfull upon ir. Even the air of the place, which can be smelled\\nfour hundred yards away—everything suggests that one is\\napproaching a place of violence, an asylum of degradation\\nand infortune.”* Many of these centers of confinement\\nwere built in the very places where the lepers had once\\nbeen kept; it was as if, across the centuries, the new tenants\\nhad received the contagion. They revived the blazon and\\n\\n(202)\\n\\x0c The Great Fear\\n\\nthe meaning that had been borne in those places: “Too\\ngreat a leper for the capital! The name of Bicétre is 2 word\\nno one can pronounce without an inexpressible feeling of\\nrepugnance, of horror and contempt. . . . It has become\\nthe receptacle for all the most monstrous and vile things to\\nbe found in society.”*\\n\\nThe evil which men had attempted to exclude by confinement reappeared, to the horror of the public, in a fantastic guise. There appeared, ramifying in every direction,\\nthe themes of an evil, both physical and moral, that enveloped in this very ambiguity the mingled powers of corrosion and horror. There prevailed, then, a sort of undifferentiated image of “rottenness” that had to do with the\\ncorruption of morals as well as with the decomposition of\\nthe flesh, and upon which were based both the repugnance\\nand the pity felt for the confined. First the evil began to\\nferment in the closed spaces of confinement. It had all the\\nvirtues attributed to acid in eighteenth-century chemistry:\\nits fine particles, sharp as needles, penetrated bodies and\\nhearts as easily as if they were passive and friable alkaline\\nparticles. The mixture boiled immediately, releasing harmful vapors and corrosive liquids: “These wards are a dreadful place where all crimes together ferment and spread\\naround them, as by fermentation, a contagious atmosphere\\nwhich those who live there breathe and which seems to\\nbecome attached to them.’ These burning vapors then\\nrise, spread through the air, and finally fall upon the neighborhood, impregnating bodies and contaminating souls.\\nThus the idea of a contagion of evil-as-rottenness is articulated in images. The palpable agent of this epidemic is air,\\nthat air which is called “tainted,” the term obscurely suggesting that it is not in conformity with the purity of its\\nnature, and that it acts as the communicating element of the\\ntaint. It is sufficient to remember the value, both moral and\\nmedical, ascribed at about the same period to country air\\n\\n(203)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c   \\n\\n \\n   \\n\\nMavwness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\n(bodily health, spiritual vigor), to realize the whole complex of contrary meanings conveyed by the corrupted air\\nof hospitals, prisons, houses of confinement. By this atmosphere laden with maleficent vapors, entire cities were\\nthreatened, whose inhabitants would be slowly impregnated with rottenness and taint.\\n\\nAnd these are not only reflections halfway between\\nmorality and medicine. We must doubtless take into account an entire literary development, 2 whole emotional,\\nperhaps political exploitation of vague fears. But in certain\\ncities there were movements of panic as real, as easy to\\ndate, as the great crises of horror that wracked the Middle\\nAges from time to time. In 1780 an epidemic spread\\nthrough Paris: its origin was attributed to the infection of\\nthe Hopital Général; there was even talk of burning the\\nbuildings of Bicétre, The police lieutenant, faced with the\\nfrenzy of the population, sent 2 commission of inquiry\\nwhich included, together with several staff doctors, the\\nDean of the Faculté and the physician of the Hépital Général. According to their findings, Bicérre was subject to a\\n“putrid fever” which was linked to the bad quality of the\\nair. As for the original source of the disease, the report\\ndenied that it lay in the internees and the infection they\\nmight spread; it must be attributed quite simply to the bad\\nweather that made the disease endemic in the capital; the\\nsymptoms that were to be observed at the Hépital Général\\nwere “in accordance with the nature of the season and exactly the same as the illnesses observed in Paris at the same\\nperiod.” The population had to be reassured and Bicétre\\ncleared of its guilt: “The rumors that have begun to spread\\nconcerning a contagious illness at Bicétre that is capable of\\ninfecting the capital are without foundation.” Evidently\\nthe report did not check the rumors completely, since some\\ntime later the physician of the Hépital Général issued another in which he made the same statement; he was forced\\n\\n(204)\\n\\x0c  \\n\\n“Stultifera Navis”\\n\\nlepers attend at a distance, but forever, that climb to Calvary on which the entire people accompanies Christ. Hieratic witnesses of evil, they accomplish their salvation in and\\nby their very exclusion: in a strange reversibility that is the\\nopposite of good works and prayer, they are saved by the\\nhand that is not stretched out. The sinner who abandons\\nthe leper at his door opens his way to heaven. “For which\\nhave patience in thy malady; for Our Lord hateth thee not\\nbecause of it, keepeth thee not from his company; but if\\nthou hast patience thou wilt be saved, as was the leper who\\ndied before the gate of the rich man and was carried\\nstraight to paradise.” Abandonment is his salvation; his exclusion offers him another form of communion.\\n\\nLeprosy disappeared, the leper vanished, or almost, from\\nmemory; these structures remained. Often, in these same\\nplaces, the formulas of exclusion would be repeated,\\nstrangely similar two or three centuries later. Poor vagabonds, criminals, and “deranged minds” would take the\\npart played by the leper, and we shall see what salvation\\nwas expected from this exclusion, for them and for those\\nwho excluded them as well. With an altogether new meaning and in a very different culture, the forms would remain--essentially that major form of a rigorous division\\nwhich is social exclusion but spiritual reintegration.\\n\\nSomething new appears in the imaginary landscape of\\nthe Renaissance; soon it will occupy a privileged place\\nthere: the Ship of Fools, a strange “drunken boat” chat\\nglides along the calm rivers of the Rhineland and the Flemish canals.\\n\\nThe Narrenschiff, of course, is a literary composition,\\nprobably borrowed from the old Argonaut cycle, one of\\nthe great mythic themes recently revived and rejuvenated,\\nacquiring an institutional aspect in the Burgundy Escates.\\nFashion favored the composition of these Ships, whose\\n\\n(7)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nThe Great Fear\\n\\nto acknowledge the poor sanitary conditions of Bicétre, but\\n“matters have not, for all that, reached the cruel extremity\\nof converting the refuge of these unforcunates into another\\nsource of inevitable evils much more lamentable than those\\nwhich require a remedy as prompt as it is efficacious.”\\n\\nThe circle was closed: all those forms of unreason which\\nhad replaced leprosy in the geography of evil, and which\\nhad been banished into the remotest social distance, now\\nbecame a visible leprosy and offered their running sores to\\nthe promiscuity of men. Unreason was once more present;\\nbut marked now by an imaginary stigma of disease, which\\nadded its powers of terror.\\n\\nThus it is in the realm of the fantastic and not within the\\nrigor of medical thought that unreason joins illness and\\ndraws closer to it. Long before the problem of discovering\\nto what degree the unreasonable is pathological was formulated, there had formed, in the space of confinement and by\\nan alchemy peculiar to it, a mélange combining the dread\\nof unreason and the old specters of disease. From a great\\ndistance, the old confusions about leprosy functioned once\\nagain; and it is the vigor of these fantastic themes which\\nwas the first agent of synthesis between the world of unreason and the medical universe. They first communicated\\nthrough the hallucinations of fear, combining the infernal\\nmixtures of “corruption” and “taint.” It is important, perhaps decisive for the place madness was to occupy in modern culture, that homo medicus was not called into the\\nworld of confinement as an arbiter, to divide what was\\ncrime from what was madness, what was evil from what\\nwas illness, but rather as a guardian, to protect others from\\nthe vague danger that exuded through the walls of confinement. It is easy to suppose that a free and generous\\nsympathy awakened interest in the fate of the confined,\\nand that a more diligent and informed medical attention\\ncould recognize disease where previously the authorities\\n\\n(203)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavDNESS & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nhad indiscriminately punished transgressions. As it happened, the atmosphere was not one of such benevolent neutrality. If a doctor was summoned, if he was asked to observe, it was because people were afraid—afraid of the\\nstrange chemistry that seethed behind the walls of confinement, afraid of the powers forming there that threatened to propagate. The doctor came, once the conversion\\nof images was effected, the disease having already assumed\\nthe ambiguous aspects of fermentation, of corruption, of\\ntainted exhalations, of decomposed flesh. What is traditionally called “progress” toward madness’s attaining a medical\\nstatus was in fact made possible only by a strange regression. In the inextricable mixture of moral and physical\\ncontagions,® and by virtue of that symbolism of Impurity\\nso familiar to the eighteenth century, very early images\\nTose again to the surface of human memory, And it was as a\\nresult of this reactivation of images, more than by an improvement of knowledge, that unreason was eventually\\nconfronted by medical thought. Paradoxically, in the return to that fantastic life which mingles with the contemporary images of illness, positivism would gain a hold\\nover unreason, or rather would discover a new reason for\\nprotecting itself against it.\\n\\nThe question, for the moment, was not to suppress the\\nhouses of confinement, but to neutralize them as potential\\ncauses of a new evil. The problem was to organize them\\nwhile purifying them. The great reform movement that\\ndeveloped in the second half of the eighteenth century\\noriginated in the effort to reduce contamination by destroying impurities and vapors, abating fermentations, preventing evil and disease from tainting the air and spreading\\ntheir contagion in the atmosphere of the cities. The hospital, the house of correction, all the places of confinement,\\nwere to be more completely isolated, surrounded by a\\npurer air: this period produced a whole literature con\\n(206)\\n\\x0c The Great Fear\\n\\ncerning the airing of hospitals, which tentatively approaches the medical problem of contagion, but aims more\\nspecifically at themes of moral communication. In 1776 a\\ndecree of the Council of State appointed a commission to\\ndetermine “the degree of amelioration of which the various\\nhospitals in France are in need.” Viel was instructed to rebuild the wards of La Salpétriére. The ideal was an asylum\\nwhich, while preserving its essential functions, would be so\\norganized that the evil could vegetate there without ever\\nspreading; an asylum where unreason would be enurely\\ncontained and offered as 2 spectacle, without threatening\\nthe spectators; where it would have all the powers of example and none of the risks of contagion. In short, an asylum restored to its truth as a cage. It is this “sterilized”\\nconfinement, if we may employ an anachronistic term, that\\nwas still, in 1789, the dream of the Abbé Desmonceaux, in a\\nlittle work dedicated to National Benevolence; he planned\\nto create a pedagogical instrument—a spectacle conclusively proving the drawbacks of immorality: “these\\nguarded asylums .. . are retreats as useful as they are\\nnecessary. . . . The sight of these shadowy places and the\\nguilty creatures they contain is well calculated to preserve\\nfrom the same acts of just reprobation the deviations of a\\ntoo licentious youth; it is thus prudent of mothers and fathers to familiarize their children at an early age with these\\nhorrible and detestable places, where shame and turpitude\\nfetter crime, where man, corrupted in his essence, often\\nloses forever the rights he had acquired in society.”\\n\\nSuch are the dreams by which morality, in complicity\\nwith medicine, tried to defend itself against the dangers\\ncontained but insufficiently restricted by confinement.\\nThese same dangers, at the same time, fascinated men’s\\nimaginations and their desires. Morality dreams of exorcising them, but there is something in man which makes him\\ndream of experiencing them, or at least of approaching\\n\\n(207)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavwness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nthem and releasing their hallucinations. The horror that\\nnow surrounded the fortresses of confinement also exercised an irresistible attraction. Such nights were peopled\\nwith inaccessible pleasures; such corrupt and ravaged faces\\nbecame masks of voluptuousness; against these dark landscapes appeared forms—pains and delights—which echoed\\nHieronymus Bosch and his delirious gardens. The secrets\\nthat escaped from the chateau in the One Hundred and\\nTwenty Days of Sodom have been murmured ever since:\\n“There, the most infamous excesses are committed upon\\nthe very person of the prisoner; we hear of certain vices\\npracticed frequently, notoriously, and even publicly in the\\ncommon room of the prison, vices which the propriety of\\nmodern times does not permit us to name. We are told that\\nnumerous prisoners, styilligni feminis mores stuprati et constupratores; that they return from this obscure, forbidden\\nplace covered over with their own and others’ debaucheries, lost to all shame and ready to commit all sorts of\\ncrimes.”” And La Rochefoucauld-Liancourt in his turn\\nevoked those figures of Old Women and Young Women in\\nthe correction wards of La Salpétriére, who from generation to generation communicate the same secrets and the\\nsame pleasures: “The correction ward is the place of greatest punishment for the House, containing when we visited\\nit forty-seven girls, most of them very young, more\\nthoughtless than guilty. . . . And always this confusion of\\nages, this shocking mixture of frivolous girls with hardened\\nwomen who can teach them only the art of the most unbridled corruption.” For a long time these visions would\\nprowl insistently through the nights of the eighteenth century. For a moment they would be picked out by the pitiless light of Sade’s work and placed by it in the rigorous\\ngeometry of Desire. They would be taken up again and\\nwrapped in the murky light of Goya’s Madhouse, or the\\ntwilight that surrounds the Quinta del Sordo. How closely\\n\\n(208)\\n\\x0c The Great Fear\\n\\nthe faces of the Disparates resemble them! A whole imaginary landscape reappears, conveyed by the Great Fear\\nconfinement now inspires.\\n\\nWhat the classical period had confined was not only an\\nabstract unreason which mingled madmen and liberunes,\\ninvalids, and criminals, but also an enormous reservoir of\\nthe fantastic, a dormant world of monsters supposedly engulfed in the darkness of Hieronymus Bosch which had\\nonce spewed them forth. One might say that the fortresses\\nof confinement added to their social role of segregation and\\npurification a quite opposite cultural function. Even as they\\nseparated reason from unreason on society’s surface, they\\npreserved in depth the images where they mingled and exchanged properties. The fortresses of confinement functioned as a great, long silent memory; they maintained in\\nthe shadows an iconographic power that men might have\\nthought was exorcised; created by the new classical order,\\nthey preserved, against it and against time, forbidden figures that could thus be transmitted intact from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century. In this abolished time, the\\nBrocken joined Dulle Griet in the same imaginary landscape, and Noirceuil, the great legend of the Maréchal de\\nRais. Confinement allowed, indeed called for, this resistance\\nof imagery.\\n\\nBut the images liberated at the end of the eighteenth\\ncentury were not identical at all points with those the seventeenth century had tried to eliminate. Something had\\nhappened, in the darkness, which detached them from that\\nsecret world where the Renaissance, after the Middle Ages,\\nhad found them; they: had lodged in the hearts, in the desires, in the imaginations of men; and instead of manifesting\\nto sight the abrupt presence of the insane, they seethed as\\nthe strange contradiction of human appetites: the complicicy of desire and murder, of cruelty and the longing to\\nsuffer, of sovereignty and slavery, of insult and humilia\\n(209)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Mavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\ntion. The great cosmic conflict whose peripities had been\\nrevealed by the Insane in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, shifted until it became, at the end of the classical\\nperiod, a dialectic lacking the heart’s mediation. Sadism is\\nnot a name finally given to a practice as old as Eros; it is a\\nmassive cultural fact which appeared precisely at the end of\\nthe eighteenth century, and which constitutes one of the\\ngreatest conversions of Western imagination: unreason\\ntransformed into delirium of the heart, madness of desire,\\nthe insane dialogue of love and death in the limitless presumption of appetite. Sadism appears at the very moment\\nthat unreason, confined for over a century and reduced to\\nsilence, reappears, no Jonger as an image of the world, no\\nlonger as a figura, but as language and desire. And it is no\\naccident that sadism, as an individual phenomenon bearing\\nthe name of a man, was born of confinement and, within\\nconfinement, that Sade’s entire oeuvre is dominated by the\\nimages of the Fortress, the Cell, the Cellar, the Convent,\\nthe inaccessible Island which thus form, as it were, the\\nnatural habitat of unreason. It is no accident, either, that all\\nthe fantastic literature of madness and horror, which is\\ncontemporary with Sade’s oeuvre, takes place, preferentally, in the strongholds of confinetnent. And this whole\\nsudden conversion of Western memory at the end of the\\neighteenth century, with its possibility of rediscovering\\ndeformed and endowed with a new meaning--figures familiar at the end of the Middle Ages: was this conversion\\nnot authorized by the survival and the reawakening of the\\nfantastic in the very places where unreason had been re~\\nduced to silence?\\n\\nIn the classical period, the awareness of madness and the\\nawareness of unreason had not separated from one another.\\nThe experience of unreason that had guided all the practices of confinement so enveloped the awareness of madness\\n\\n(210)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nThe Great Fear\\n\\nthat it very nearly permitted it to disappear, sweeping it\\nalong a road of regression where it was close to losing its\\nmost specific elements.\\n\\nBut in the anxiety of the second half of the eighteenth\\ncentury, the fear of madness grew at the same time as the\\ndread of unreason: and thereby the two forms of obsession,\\nleaning upon each other, continued to reinforce each other. .\\nAnd at the very moment we note the liberation of the\\niconographic powers that accompany unreason, we hear on\\nall sides complaints about the ravages of madness. Already\\nwe are familiar with the concern generated by “nervous\\ndiseases,” and the awareness that man becomes more delicate in proportion as he perfects himself. As the century\\nadvanced, the concern became more pressing, the warnings\\nmore solemn. Already Raulin had observed that “since the\\nbirch of medicine . . . these illnesses have multiplied, have\\nbecome more dangerous, more complicated, more problematical and difficult to cure.” By Tissot’s time, this general impression became a firm belief, a sort of medical\\ndogma: nervous diseases “were formerly much less frequent than they are nowadays; and this for two reasons:\\none, that men were in general more robust, and less frequently ill; there were fewer diseases of any kind; the\\nother, that the causes which produce nervous diseases in\\nespecial have multiplied in a greater proportion, in recent\\ntimes, than the other general causes of illness, some of\\nwhich even seem to have diminished. . . . I do not hesitate\\nto say that if they were once the rarest, they are today the\\nmost frequent.”® And soon men regained that awareness,\\nwhich had been so intense in the sixteenth century, of the\\nprecariousness of a reason that can at any moment be compromised, and definitively, by madness, Matthey, a Geneva\\nphysician very close to Rousseau’s influence, formulates the\\nprospect for all men of reason: “Do not glory in your state,\\nif you are wise and civilized men; an instant suffices to\\n\\n(282)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c   \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nMavNEss & CIVILIZATION\\n\\ndisturb and annihilate that supposed wisdom of which you\\nare so proud; an unexpected event, a sharp and sudden\\nemotion of the soul will abruptly change the most reasonable and intelligent man into a raving idiot.” The threat of\\nmadness resumes its place among the emergencies of the\\ncentury.\\n\\nThis awareness, however, has a very special style. The\\nobsession with unreason is a very affective one, involved in\\nthe movement of iconographic resurrections. The fear of\\nmadness is much freer with regard to this heritage; and\\nwhile the return of unreason has the aspect of a massive\\nrepetition, connecting with itself outside of time, the\\nawareness of madness is on the contrary accompanied by a\\ncertain analysis of modernity, which siruates it from the\\nstart in a temporal, historical, and social context. In the\\ndisparity between the awareness of unreason and the\\nawareness of madness, we have, at the end of the eighteenth\\ncentury, the point of departure for a decisive movement:\\nthat by which the experience of unreason will continue,\\nwith Holderlin, Nerval, and Nietzsche, to proceed ever\\ndeeper toward the roots of time—unreason thus becoming,\\npar excellence, the world’s contratempo—and the know!ledge of madness seeking on the contrary to situate it ever\\nmore precisely within the development of nature and history. It is after this period that the time of unreason and the\\ntime of madness receive two opposing vectors: one being\\nunconditioned return and absolute submersion; the other,\\non the contrary, developing according to the chronicle of a\\nhistory.*\\n\\n1. Madness and Liberty. For a long time, certain forms\\nof melancholia were considered specifically English; this\\nwas a fact in medicine and a constant in literature. Montesquieu contrasted Roman suicide, which was a form of\\nmoral and political behavior, the desired effect of a concerted education, with English suicide, which had to be\\n\\n(212)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c The Great Fear\\n\\nconsidered as an illness since “the English kill themselves\\nwithout any apparent reason for doing so; they kill themselves in the very lap of happiness.” It is here that the\\nmilieu plays its role, for if happiness in the eighteenth century is part of the order of nature and reason, unhappiness,\\nor at least whatever deters from happiness without reason,\\nmust be part of another order. This order was sought first\\nin the excesses of the climate, in nature’s deviation from its\\nequilibrium and its happy mean (temperate climates are\\ncaused by nature; intemperate climates by the milieu). But\\nthis was not sufficient to explain /a maladie anglaise; already\\nCheyne had declared that wealth, refined food, the abundance ail the inhabitants enjoyed, the life of pleasure and\\nease the richest society led, were at the origin of such nervous disorders. Increasingly, a political and economic explanation was sought, in which wealth, progress, institutions appear as the determining element of madness. At the\\nbeginning of the nineteenth century, Spurzheim made 2\\nsynthesis of all these analyses in one of the last texts devoted to them.\\'® Madness, “more frequent in England than\\nanywhere else,” is merely the penalty of the liberty that\\nreigns there, and of the wealth universally enjoyed. Freedom of conscience entails more dangers than authority and\\ndespotism. “Religious sentiments . . . exist without restriction; every individual is entitled to preach to anyone\\nwho will listen to him,” and by listening to such different\\nopinions, “minds are disturbed in the search for truth.”\\nDangers of indecision, of an irresolute attention, of a vacillating soul! The danger, too, of disputes, of passions, of\\nobstinacy: “Everything meets with opposition, and opposition excites the feelings; in religion, in politics, in science,\\nas in everything, each man is permitted to form an opinion;\\nbut he must expect to meet with opposition.” Nor does so\\nmuch liberty permit a man to master time; every man is left\\nto his own uncertainty, and the State abandons all to their\\n\\n(273)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c   \\n\\n    \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nfluctuations: “The English are 2 nation of merchants; a\\nmind always occupied with speculations is continually agitated by fear and hope. Egotism, the soul of commerce,\\neasily becomes envious and summons other faculties to its\\naid,” Besides, this liberty is far from true natural liberty: on\\nall sides it is constrained and harried by demands opposed\\nto the most legitimate desires of individuals: this is the liberty of interests, of coalitions, of financial combinations,\\nnot of man, not of minds and hearts. For financial reasons,\\nfamilies are here more tyrannical than anywhere else: only\\nwealthy girls are able to marry; “the others are reduced to\\nother means of satisfaction that ruin the body and derange\\nthe manifestations of the soul. The same cause favors\\nlibertinage, which predisposes to madness.” A mercantile\\nliberty thus appears as the element in which opinion can\\nnever arrive at the truth, in which the immediate is necessarily subject to contradiction, in which time escapes the\\nmastery and certainty of the seasons, in which man is dispossessed of his desires by the laws of interest. In short,\\n\\' Hberty, far from putting man in possession of himself,\\nceaselessly alienates him from his essence and his world; it\\nfascinates him in the absolute exteriority of other people\\nand of money, in the irreversible interiority of passion and\\nunfulfilled desire. Between man and the happiness of a\\nworld in which he recognizes himself, between man and 2\\nnature in which he finds his truth, the liberty of the mercantile state is “milieu”: and to this very degree it is the\\ndetermining element of madness. When Spurzheim was\\nwriting—at the height of the Holy Alliance, during the\\nrestoration of the authoritarian monarchies—liberalism was\\nreadily blamed for all the sins of the world’s madness: “It is\\nsingular to see that man’s greatest desire, which is his personal liberty, has its disadvantages as well.” But for us, the\\npoint of such an analysis is not its critique of liberty, but its\\nvery employment of the notion that designates for Spurz\\n(2714)\\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\ncrew of imaginary heroes, ethical models, or social types\\nembarked on a great symbolic voyage which would bring\\nthem, if not fortune, then at least the figure of their destiny\\nor their truth. Thus Symphorien Champier composes a\\nShip of Princes and Battles of Nobility in 1502, then a Ship\\nof Virtuous Ladies in 1503; there is also a Ship of Health,\\nalongside the Blauwe Schute of Jacob van Oestvoren in\\n1413, Sebastian Brant’s Narrenschiff (1494), and the work\\nof Josse Bade:Stultiferae naviculae scaphae fatuarum mulierum (1498). Bosch’s painting, of course, belongs to this\\ndream fleet.\\n\\nBut of all these romantic or satiric vessels, the Narrenschiff is the only one that had a real existence—for they did\\nexist, these boats that conveyed their insane cargo from\\ntown to town. Madmen then led an easy wandering existence. The towns drove them outside their limits; they were\\nallowed to wander in the open countryside, when not entrusted to a group of merchants and pilgrims. The custom\\nwas especially frequent in Germany; in Nuremberg, in the\\nfirst half of the fifteenth century, the presence of 63 madmen had been registered; 31 were driven away; in the fifty\\nyears that followed, there are records of 21 more obligatory departures; and these are only the madmen arrested by\\nthe municipal authorities. Frequently they were handed\\nover to boatmen: in Frankfort, in 1399, seamen were instructed to rid the city of a madman who walked about the\\nstreets naked; in the first years of the fifteenth century, a\\ncriminal madman was expelled in the same manner from\\nMainz. Sometimes the sailors disembarked these bothersome\\npassengers sooner than they had promised; witness a blacksmith of Frankfort twice expelled and twice returning before being taken to Kreuznach for good. Often the cities of\\nEurope must have seen these “ships of fools” approaching\\ntheir harbors.\\n\\nIc is not easy to discover the exact meaning of this cus\\n(8)\\n\\x0c The Great Fear\\n\\nheim the non-natural milieu in which the psychological and\\nphysiological mechanisms of madness are favored, amplified, and multiplied.\\n\\n2. Madness, Religion, and Time. Religious beliefs prepare a kind of landscape of images, an illusory milieu f2vorable to every hallucination and every delirium. For 2\\nIong time, doctors were suspicious of the effects of too\\nstrict a devotion, too strong a belief. Too much moral\\nrigor, too much anxiety about salvation and the life to\\ncome were often thought to bring on melancholia. The\\nEncyclopédie does not fail to cite such cases: “The intemperate impressions made by certain extravagant preachers,\\nthe excessive fears they inspire of the pains with which our\\nreligion threatens those who break its laws, produce astonishing revolutions in weak minds. At the hospital of Montélimar, several women were reported suffering from mania\\nand melancholia as a result of a mission held in that city;\\nthese creatures were ceaselessly struck by the horrible\\nimages that had thoughtlessly been presented to them; they\\nspoke of nothing but despair, revenge, punishment, etc.,\\nand one of them absolutely refused to undergo any cure,\\nconvinced that she was in Hell and that nothing could extinguish the fire she believed was devouring her.” Pinel follows the line of these enlightened physicians—forbidding\\nbooks of devotion to be given to “melancholics by piety,”\\neven recommending solitary confinement for “religious\\npersons who believe themselves to be inspired and who seek\\nto make proselytes.” But this again is more of a critique\\nthan a positive analysis: the religious object or theme is\\nsuspected of arousing delirium and hallucination by the delirious and hallucinatory nature attributed to it. Pinel reports the case of a recently cured madman who had “read\\nin a religious book . . . that each man has his guardian\\nangel; on the following night, he thought he was surrounded by: a choir of angels and imagined he heard celes\\n(215)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Mavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\ntial music and received revelations.” Religion is considered\\nhere only as an element in the transmission of error. But\\neven before Pinel, there had been analyses of a more rigorous historical nature, in which religion appeared as a milieu\\nof satisfaction or repression of the passions. In 1781 2 German author described as happy those distant eras when\\npriests were endowed with absolute powers: then idleness\\ndid not exist, every moment was marked by “ceremonies,\\nreligious practices, pilgrimages, visits to the poor and the\\nsick, calendar festivals.”\"\" Time was thus assigned to an\\norganized happiness, which left no leisure for empty passions, for disgust with life, for boredom. If a man felt\\nguilty, he was subjected to real, often material punishment\\nwhich occupied his mind and gave him an assurance that\\nthe transgression was redressed. And when the confessor\\nencountered those “hypochondriacal penitents who came\\ntoo often to confession,” he assigned them as penance either a severe hardship that “diluted their too thick blood,”\\nor Jong pilgrimages: “The change of air, the length of the\\nroad, absence from home, distance from the things which\\nupset them, their associations with other pilgrims, the slow\\nand energetic movement of walking, had more effect upon\\nthem than the comfortable journeys . . . that in our day\\ntake the place of pilgrimages.” Finally, the sacred nature of\\nthe priest gave each of his injunctions an absolute value,\\nand no one dreamed of trying to avoid it; “usually che\\nwhims of sick people deny all this to the physician.” For\\nMocehsen, religion is the mediation between man and transgression, between man and punishment: in the form of an\\nauthoritarian synthesis, it suppresses the transgression by\\nimposing the punishment; if, on the contrary, religion\\nloosens its hold but maintains the ideal forms of remorse of\\nconscience, of spiritual mortification, it leads directly to\\nmadness; only the consistency of the religious milieu can\\npermit man to escape alienation in the excessive delirium of\\n\\n(2716)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c The Great Fear\\n\\ntransgressions. By accomplishing its rites and its requirements, man avoids both the useless idleness of his passions\\nbefore the transgression, and the vain repetition of his remorse once the transgression is committed; religion organizes all human life around fulfillment of the moment. That\\nold religion of happier times was the perpetual celebration\\nof the present. But once it was idealized in the modern age,\\nreligion cast a temporal halo around the present, an empty\\nmilieu—that of idleness and remorse, in which the heart of\\nman is abandoned to its own anxiety, in which the passions\\nsurrender time to unconcern or to repetition in which, finally, madness can function freely.\\n\\n3. Madness, Civilization, and Sensibility. Civilization, in\\na general way, constitutes a milieu favorable to the development of madness. If the progress of knowledge dissipates\\nerror, it also has the effect of propagating a taste and even a\\nmania for study; the life of the library, abstract speculations, the perpetual agitation of the mind without the exercise of the body, can have the most disastrous effects. Tissot explains that in the human body it is those parts subject\\nto frequent work which are first strengthened and hardened; among laborers, the muscles and fibers of the arms\\nharden, giving them their physical strength and the good\\nhealth they enjoy until an advanced age; “among men of\\nletters, the brain hardens; often they become incapable of\\nconnecting their ideas,” and so are doomed to dementia.\\nThe more abstract or complex knowledge becomes, the\\ngreater the risk of madness. A body of knowledge still close\\nto what is most immediate in the senses, requiring, according to Pressavin, only a little work on the part of the inner\\nsense and organs of the brain, provokes only a sort of physiological happiness: “The sciences whose objects are easily\\nperceived by our senses, which offer the soul agreeable relations because of the harmony of their consonance. . .\\nperform throughout the entire bodily machine a light ac\\n(277)\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\x0c MapneEss & CIVILIZATION\\n\\ntivity which is beneficial to all the functions.” On the contrary, a knowledge too poor in these sensuous relations, too\\nfree with regard to the immediate, provokes a tension of\\nthe brain alone which disequilibrates the whole body; sciences “of things whose relationships are difficult to grasp\\nbecause they are not readily available to our senses, or because their too complicated relations oblige us to expend\\ngreat application in their study, present the soul with an\\nexercise that greatly fatigues the inner sense by a too continuous tension upon that organ.” Knowledge thus forms\\naround feeling a milieu of abstract relationships where man\\nrisks losing the physical happiness in which his relation to\\nthe world is usually: established. Knowledge multiplies, no\\ndoubt, but its cost increases too. Is it certain that there are\\nmore wise men today? One thing, at least, is certain: “rhere\\nare more people who have the infirmities of wisdom.” The\\nmilieu of knowledge grows faster than knowledge itself.\\n\\nBut it is not only knowledge that detaches man from\\nfeeling; it is sensibility itself: a sensibility that is no longer\\ncontrolled by the movements of nature, bur by all the habits, all the demands of social life. Modern man—but woman\\nmore than man—turns day into night and night into day:\\n“The moment at which our women rise in Paris is far re~\\nmoved from that which nature has indicated; the best hours\\nof the day have slipped away; the purest air has disappeared; no one has benefited from it. The vapors, the harmful exhalations, attracted by the sun’s heat, are already rising in the atmosphere; this is the hour that beauty chooses\\nto rise.”!? This disorder of the senses continues in the theater, where illusions are cultivated, where vain passions and\\nthe most fatal movements of the soul are aroused by artifice; women especially enjoy these spectacles “that inflame\\nand arouse them”; their souls “are so strongly shaken that\\nthis produces a commotion in their nerves, fleeting, in\\ntruth, but whose consequences are usually serious; the\\n\\n(278)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c The Great Fear\\n\\nmomentary loss of their senses, the tears they shed at the\\nperformances of our modern tragedies are the least accidents that can result from them.” Novels form a still\\nmore artificial milieu, and are more dangerous to a disordered sensibility; the verisimilitude modern authors attempt to produce, and all the art they employ to imitate\\ntruth, only give more prestige to the violent and dangerous\\nsentiments they seek to awaken in their female readers: “In\\nthe earliest epochs of French gallantry and manners, the\\nless perfected minds of women were content with facts and\\nevents as marvelous as they were unbelievable; now they\\ndemand believable facts yet sentiments so marvelous that\\ntheir own minds are disturbed and confounded by them,\\nthey then seek, in all that surrounds them, to realize the\\nmarvels by which they are enchanted; but everything\\nseems to them without sentiment and without life, because\\nthey are trying to find what does not exist in nature.\"\\nThe novel constitutes the milieu of perversion, par excellence, of all sensibility; it detaches the soul from all that is\\nimmediate and natural in feeling and leads it into an imaginary world of sentiments violent in proportion to their\\nunreality, and less controlled by the gentle laws of nature;\\n“The existence of so many authors has produced 2 host of\\nreaders, and continued reading generates every nervous\\ncomplaint; perhaps of all the causes that have harmed\\nwomen’s health, the principal one has been the infinite multiplication of novels in the last hundred years . . . a girl\\nwho at ten reads instead of running will, at twenty, be a\\nwoman with the vapors and not a good nurse.”\\n\\nSlowly, and still in a very scattered fashion, the eighteenth century constituted, around its awareness of madness and of its threatening spread, 2 whole new order of\\nconcepts. In the landscape of unreason where the sixteenth\\ncentury had located it, madness concealed a meaning and\\nan origin that were obscurely moral; its secrecy related it to\\n\\n(279)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Mavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nsin, and the animality imminently perceived in it did not\\nmake it, paradoxically, more innocent. In the second half of\\nthe eighteenth century, madness was no longer recognized\\nin what brings man closer to an immemorial fall or an indefinitely present animality; it was, on the contrary, situated in those distances man takes in regard to himself, to his\\nworld, to all that is offered by the immediacy of nature;\\nmadness became possible in that milieu where man’s relations with his feelings, with time, with others, are altered;\\nmadness was possible because of everything which, in\\nman’s life and development, is a break with the immediate.\\nMadness was no longer of the order of nature or of the\\nFall, but of a new order, in which men began to have a\\npresentiment of history, and where there formed, in an\\nobscure originating relationship, the “alienation” of the\\nphysicians and the “alienation” of the philosophers—two\\nconfigurations in which man in any case corrupts his truth,\\nbut between which the nineteenth century, after Hegel,\\nsoon lost all trace of resemblance.\\n\\n \\n\\x0c VIII\\n\\ner\\n\\nTHE NEW DIVISION\\n\\nEvery psychiatrist, every historian yielded, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, to the same impulse of indignation; everywhere we find the same outrage, the same\\nvirtuous censure: “No one blushed to put the insane in\\nprison.” And Esquirol, listing the fortress of Ha in Bordeaux, the houses of correction in Toulouse and Rennes,\\nthe “Bicétres” still existing in Poitiers, in Caen, in Amiens,\\nthe “Chateau” of Angers, continues: “Moreover, there are\\nfew prisons where the raving mad are not to be found;\\nthese unfortunates are chained in dungeons beside criminals. What a monstrous association! The calm madmen are\\ntreated worse than malefactors.”\\n\\nThe entire century echoes him; in England, it was the\\nTukes, who had turned historians and apologists for their\\nancestral occupation; in Germany, after Wagnitz, it was\\nReil who groaned over those wretches “thrown, like State\\ncriminals, into dungeons where the eye of humanity never\\npenetrates.” The age of positivism, for over half a century,\\nconstantly claimed to have been the first to free the mad\\n\\n(227)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Mavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\n  \\n \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n\\nfrom a lamentable confusion with the felonious, to separate\\nthe innocence of unreason from the guilt of crime.\\n\\nYet it is simple enough to show the vanity of this claim.\\nFor years the same protests had been raised; before Reil,\\nthere had been Franck: “Those who have visited the insane\\nasylums of Germany recall with dread what they have\\nseen. One is horrified upon entering these asylums of misery and affliction; one hears only cries of despair, yet here\\ndwells the man distinguished by his talents and his virtues.”\\nBefore Esquirol, before Pinel, there had been La Rochefoucauld-Liancourt, there had been Tenon; and before them,\\nan incessant murmur throughout the eighteenth century,\\ncomposed of insistent protests, lodged year after year even\\nby those whom one would have thought the most indifferent, the most eager perhaps that such a confusion should\\nsubsist. Twenty-five years before the exclamations of a\\nPinel, we must invoke Malesherbes “visiting the State prisons with the intention of breaking down their gates. Pris~\\noners whom he found to be insane ... were sent to\\nhouses where the society, the exercise, and the care he had\\nscrupulously prescribed would be sure, he said, to cure\\nthem.” Still earlier in the century, and in a lower voice,\\nthere had been all those directors, those bursars, those overseers who from generation to generation always asked and\\nsometimes achieved the same thing: the separation of madmen from convicts; there had been the Prior of La Charité\\nin Senlis who begged the police to remove several prisoners\\nand confine them instead in any of several fortresses; there\\nhad been that overseer of the House of Correction in\\nBrunswick who asked--and this was only in 1713—that\\nthe madmen not be allowed to mingle with the internees\\nassigned to the workshops. Had not what the nineteenth\\ncentury formulated so ostentatiously, with all the resources\\nof its pathos, already been whispered and indefatigably repeated by the eighteenth? Did Esquirol and Reil and the\\n\\n(222)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c The New Division\\n\\nTukes do anything more than shout at the top of their\\nlungs what had been, for years, commonplaces of asylum\\npractice? The slow emigration of the mad which we have\\nmentioned, from 1720 to the Revolution, was probably no\\nmore than the most visible effect of that practice.\\n\\nAnd yet, let us listen to what was being said in this halfsilence. When the Prior of Senlis asked that madmen be\\nseparated from certain convicts, what were his arguments?\\n“He is deserving of mercy, as well as cwo or three others\\nwho would be better off in some citadel, because of the\\ncompany of six others who are mad, and who torment\\nthem night and day.” And the meaning of this sentence\\nwould be so clearly understood by the police chat the intemees in question would be set free. And the demands of\\nthe Brunswick overseer have the same meaning: the workshop is disturbed by the cries and the confusion of the\\ninsane; their frenzy is a perpetual danger, and it would be\\nbetter to send them back to the cells, or to keep them in\\nchains. And already, we can anticipate that from one cen~\\ntury to the next, the same protests did not have, at bottom,\\nthe same value. Early in the nineteenth century, there was\\nindignation that the mad were not treated any better than\\nthose condemned by common law or than State prisoners;\\nthroughout the eighteenth century, emphasis was placed on\\nthe fact that the prisoners deserved a better fate than one\\nthat lumped them with the insane. For Esquirol, the scandal\\nis due to the fact that the mad are only mad, for the\\nPrior of Senlis, to the fact that the convicts are, after all,\\nonly convicts.\\n\\nA difference which is perhaps not of such significance,\\nand which ought to have been easily perceived. And yet, it\\nis necessary to emphasize it in order co understand how\\nthe consciousness of madness was transformed in the course\\nof the eighteenth century. It did not evolve in the context\\nof a humanitarian movement that gradually related it more\\n\\n(223)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Mavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nclosely to the madman’s human reality, to his most affecting and most intimate aspect; nor did it evolve under the\\npressure of a scientific need that made it more attentive,\\nmore faithful to what madness might have to say for itself.\\nIf it slowly changed, it was within that simultaneously real\\nand artificial space of confinement. Certain imperceptible\\nshifts in its strucrures, or at times certain violent crises,\\ngradually formed the awareness of madness contemporaneous with the Revolution. No medical advance, no humanitarian approach was responsible for the fact that the mad\\nwere gradually isolated, thar the monotony of insanity was\\ndivided into rudimentary types. It was the depths of confinement itself that generated the phenomenon; it is from\\nconfinement that we must seek an account of this new\\nawareness of madness.\\n\\nA political more than a philanthropic awareness. For if\\nthe eighteenth century perceived that there were among\\nthe confined—among the libertines, the debauched, the\\nprodigal sons--certain men whose confusion and disorder\\nwere of another nature, and whose anxiety was irreducible,\\nthis perception was the result of the confined themselves.\\nThey were the first to protest, and with the most violence.\\nMinisters, police officers, magistrates were assailed with the\\nsame endless and tirelessly repeated complaints: one man\\nwrites to Maurepas, indignant at being “forced to mingle\\nwith madmen, some of whom are so violent that at every\\nmoment I risk suffering dangerous abuse from them”; another—the Abbé de Montcrif—makes the same complaint\\nto Lieutenant Berryer: “This is the ninth month that I have\\nbeen confined here in this dreadful place with fifteen or\\ntwenty raving madmen, pell-mell with epileptics.” The farther we advance into the century, the stronger grow these\\nprotests against confinement: increasingly, madness becomes the specter of the internees, the very image of their\\nhumiliation, of their reason vanquished and reduced to si\\n(224)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c “Stultifera Navis”\\n\\ntom. One might suppose it was a general means of extradition by which municipalities sent wandering madmen out\\nof their own jurisdiction; a hypothesis which will not in\\nitself account for the facts, since certain madmen, even before special houses were built for them, were admitted to\\nhospitals and cared for as such; at the Hétel-Dieu in Paris,\\ntheir cots were set up in the dormitories. Moreover, in the\\nmajority of the cities of Europe there existed throughout\\nthe Middle Ages and the Renaissance a place of detention\\nreserved for the insane; there was for example the Chatelet\\nof Melun or the famous Tour aux Fous in Caen; there were\\nthe numberless Narrtiirmer of Germany, like the gates of\\nLiibeck or the Jungpfer of Hamburg. Madmen were thus\\nnot invariably expelled. One might then speculate that\\namong them only foreigners were driven away, each city\\nagreeing to care for those madmen among its own citizens.\\nDo we not in fact find among the account books of certain\\nmedieval cities subsidies for madmen or donations made\\nfor the care of the insane? However, the problem is not\\nso simple, for there existed gathering places where the\\nmadmen, more numerous than elsewhere, were not autochthonous. First come the shrines: Saint-Mathurin de\\nLarchant, Saint-Hildevert de Gournay, Besancon, Gheel;\\npilgrimages to these places were organized, often supported, by cities or hospitals. It is possible that these ships\\nof fools, which haunted the imagination of the entire\\nearly Renaissance, were pilgrimage boats, highly symbolic\\ncargoes of madmen in search of their reason: some went\\ndown the Rhineland rivers toward Belgium and Gheel;\\nothers sailed up the Rhine toward the Jura and Besangon.\\nBut other cities, like Nuremberg, were certainly not\\nshrines and yet contained great numbers of madmen—\\nmany more, in any case, than could have been furnished by\\nthe city itself. These madmen were housed and provided\\nfor in the city budget, and yet they were not given treat\\n(9)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c The New Division\\n\\nlence. The day soon comes when Mirabeau recognizes in\\nthe shameful promiscuity of madness both a subtle instrument of brutality against those to be punished and the very\\nimage of despotism, bestiality triumphant. The madman is\\nnot the first and the most innocent victim of confinement,\\nbut the most obscure and the most visible, the most insistent of the symbols of the confining power. Tyranny\\nsecretly persists among the confined in this lurid presence\\nof unreason. The struggle against the established powers,\\nagainst the family, against the Church, continues at the\\nvery heart of confinement, in the saturnalia of reason. And\\nmadness so well represents these punishing powers that ic\\neffectively plays the part of an additional punishment, a\\nfurther torment which maintains order in the uniform\\nchastisement of the houses of correction. La Rochefoucauld-Liancourt bears witness to this in his report to the\\nCommittee on Mendicitry: “One of the punishments ‘inflicted upon the epileptics and upon the other patients of\\nthe wards, even upon the deserving poor, is to place them\\namong the mad.” The scandal lies only in the fact that the\\nmadmen are the brutal truth. of confinement, the passive\\ninstrument of all that is worst about it. Is this not symbolized by the fact--also a commonplace of all the literature\\nof confinement in the eighteenth century—that a sojourn\\nin a house of correction necessarily leads to madness? Having to live in this delirious world, amid the triumph of\\nunreason, how may one avoid joining, by the fatality of the\\nsite and the event, the very men who are its living symbol?\\n“T observe that the majority of the insane confined in the\\nhouses of correction and the State prisons have become so,\\nthe latter through the excess of ill-treatment, the former ~\\nthrough the horror of the solitude in which they continually encounter the harassments of an imagination sharpened by pain.”*\\n\\nThe presence of madmen among the prisoners is not the\\n\\n(225)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c   \\n\\n \\n   \\n\\nManvness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nscandalous limit of confinement, but its truth; not abuse,\\nbut essence. The polemic instituted by the eighteenth century against confinement certainly dealt with the enforced\\nmingling of the mad and the sane; but it did not deal with\\nthe basic relation acknowledged between madness and confinement. Whatever attitude is adopted, thar, at least, is not\\nin question. Mirabeau, the Friend of Man, is as severe about\\nconfinement as about the confined themselves; in his eyes,\\nno one confined in “the celebrated State prisons” is innocent; but his place is not in these costly institutions, where\\nhe drags out a useless life; why confine “daughters of joy\\nwho, transported to provincial manufactories, could become daughters of labor”? Or “rascals who are waiting\\nonly for freedom in order to get themselves hanged? Why\\nare these people, attached to walking fetters, not employed\\nat those tasks which might prove harmful to voluntary\\nworkers? They would serve as an example . . .” Once this\\nentire population was removed, who would remain in the\\nhouses of confinement? Those who could not be placed\\nanywhere else, and who belong there by right: “Some prisoners of State whose crimes must not be revealed,” to\\nwhom may be added “old men who, having consumed in\\ndebauchery and dissipation all the fruit of their life’s labor,\\nand having cherished the ambitious prospect of dying in a\\nhospital, come there in peace”; finally, the mad, who must\\nwallow somewhere: “These last can vegetate anywhere.”*\\nMirabeau the younger conducts his demonstration in the\\nopposite direction: “I formally defy anyone in the world to\\nprove that State prisoners, rascals, libertines, madmen,\\nruined old men constitute I do not say the majority, but the\\nthird, the fourth, the tenth part of the inhabitants of fortresses, houses of correction, and State prisons.” For him\\nthe scandal is thus not that the mad are mingled with the\\ncriminal, but that they do not constitute, together, the essential part of the confined population; who then can com\\n(226)\\n\\x0c The New Division\\n\\nplain of being forced to mix with criminals? Not those who\\nhave lost their reason forever, but those who in their youth\\nspent their time in wildness: “I might ask . . . why rascals\\nand libertines are mingled together. . . . I could ask why\\nyoung men with dangerous dispositions are left with men\\nwho will rapidly lead them to the last degree of corrup~\\ntion Finally, if this confusion of libertines and villains exes, as is all too true, why do we, by this odious,\\ninfamous, atrocious combination, make ourselves guilty of\\nthe most abominable of all crimes, that of leading men into\\ncrime?” As for madmen, what other fate could be desired\\nfor them? Neither reasonable enough not to be confined,\\nnor wise enough not to be treated as wicked, “it is all too\\ntrue that those who have lost the use of reason must be\\nhidden from society.”*\\n\\nWe see how the political critique of confinement functioned in the eighteenth century. Not in the direction of a\\nliberation of the mad; nor can we say that it permitted a\\nmore philanthropic or a greater medical attention to the\\ninsane. On the contrary, it linked madness more firmly\\nthan ever to confinement, and this by a double tie: one\\nwhich made madness the very symbol of the confining\\npower and its absurd and obsessive representative within\\nthe world of confinement; the other which designated\\nmadness as the object par excellence of all che measures of\\nconfinement. Subject and object, image and goal of repression, symbol of its blind arbitrariness and justification of alk\\nthat could be reasonable and deserved within it: by a paradoxical circle, madness finally appears as the only reason\\nfor a confinement whose profound unreason it symbolizes.\\nStill so close to this eighteenth-century notion, Michelet\\nwould formulate it with an astonishing rigor; he returns to\\nthe very movement of Mirabeau’s thought, apropos of the\\nstay the latter made at Vincennes at the same time as Sade:\\n\\nFirst, confinement causes alienation: “Prison makes men\\n\\n(227)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Mavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nmad, Those found in the Bastille and in Bicétre were stupefied.”\\n\\nSecondly, what is most unreasonable, most shameful,\\nmost profoundly immoral in the tyranny of the eighteenth\\ncentury is represented in the space of confinement, and by\\na madman: “We have seen the frenzies of La Salpétrigre. A\\ndreadful lunatic existed at Vincennes, the poisonous de\\nSade, writing in the hope of corrupting the time to come.”\\n\\nThirdly, it is for this one madman alone that confinement ought to have been reserved, and nothing of the kind\\nwas done: “He was soon set free, and Mirabeau kept in\\nconfinement.”\\n\\nHence an abyss yawns in the middle of confinement; a\\nvoid which isolates madness, denounces it for being irreducible, unbearable to reason; madness now appears with\\nwhat distinguishes it from all these confined forms as well.\\nThe presence of the mad appears as an injustice; but for\\nothers. The undifferentiated unity of unreason had been\\nbroken. Madness was individualized, strangely twinned\\nwith crime, at least linked with it by a proximity which had\\nnot yet been called into question. In this confinement\\ndrained of a part of its content, these two figures—madness, crime—subsist alone; by themselves, they symbolize\\nwhat may be necessary about it; they alone are what henceforth deserves to be confined. Having taken its distance,\\nhaving finally become an assignable form in the confused\\nworld of unreason, did not liberate madness; between madness and confinement, a profound relation had been instituted, a link which was almost one of essence.\\n\\nBut at the same moment, confinement suffered another,\\nstill deeper crisis that called into question not only its repressive role but its very existence; a crisis which arose not\\nfrom within, and which was not attached to political pro\\n(228)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c The New Division\\n\\ntests, but which slowly appeared on the entire social and\\neconomic horizon.\\n\\nPoverty was gradually being freed from the old moral\\nconfusions. Men had seen unemployment assume, during\\ncrises, an aspect that could no longer be identified with that\\nof sloth; had seen indigence and idleness forced to spread\\ninto the countryside, where men had supposed they could\\nrecognize precisely the most immediate and che purest\\nforms of moral life; all this revealed that poverty was perhaps not only of the order of transgression: “Mendicity is\\nthe fruit of poverty, which itself is the resule of accidents\\noccurring either in the cultivation of the land or in the\\nproduction of manufactures, or in the rise of commodity\\nprices, in an excess of population, etc. . . .”* Poverty had\\nbecome an economic phenomenon,\\n\\nBut not contingent—nor destined to be suppressed forever. There was a certain quantity of indigence which man\\nwould not succeed in eliminating—a kind of fatality of\\n\\npoverty which must accompany all the forms of society to\\nthe end of time, even where all the idle were employed:\\n“There need be, in a well-governed state, only those poor\\n\\nborn in indigence, or those who fall into it by accident.”*\\n\\nThis basic poverty was in a sense inalienable: birth or accident, it formed a part of life that could not be avoided.\\nFor a long time, it was inconceivable to have a state in\\nwhich there were no paupers, so deeply did need appear to\\nbe inscribed in man’s fate and in the structure of society:\\nproperty, labor, and poverty are terms which remain linked\\nin the thought of philosophers until the nineteenth century.\\n\\nNecessary because it could not be suppressed, this role of\\npoverty was necessary too because it made wealth possible.\\nBecause they labor and consume little, those who are in\\nneed permit a nation to enrich itself, to set a high value on\\nits fields, its colonies, and its mines, to manufacture prod\\n(229)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c   \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nMavwness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nucts which will be sold the world over; in short, a people\\nwould be poor which had no paupers. Indigence becomes\\nan indispensable element in the State. In it is concealed the\\nsecret but also the real life of a society. The poor constitute\\nthe basis and the glory of nations. And their poverty,\\nwhich cannot be suppressed, must be exalted and revered:\\n“My purpose is merely to attract a share of that vigilant\\nattention [that of the government] to the suffering portion\\nof the People . . .; the succor it is owed derives essentially\\nfrom the honor and the prosperity of an Empire, of which\\nthe Poor are everywhere the firmest support, for a sovereign cannot preserve and extend his realm without favoring\\nthe population, the cultivation of the Land, the Arts, and\\ncommerce; and the Poor are the necessary agents of these\\ngreat powers which establish the true strength of a People.”* Here is an entire moral rehabilitation of the Pauper,\\nwhich designates, at a deeper level, a social and economic\\nreintegration of his role and character. In the mercantilist\\neconomy, the Pauper, being neither producer nor consamer, had no place: idle, vagabond, unemployed, he belonged only to confinement, 2 measure by which he was\\nexiled and as it were abstracted from society. With the\\nnascent industry which needs manpower, he once again\\nplays a part in the body of the nation.\\n\\nThus, economic thought elaborates on new foundations\\nthe notion of poverty. There had been the entire Christian\\ntradition for which the Poor Man had had a real and con,\\ncrete existence, a presence of flesh and blood: an always\\nindividual countenance of need, the symbolic passage of\\nGod in man’s image. The abstraction of confinement had\\nremoved the Poor Man, had identified him with other figures, enveloping him in an ethical condemnation, but had\\nnot dissociated him from his features. The eighteenth century discovered that “the Poor” did not exist as a concrete\\n\\n(230)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\n \\n\\nThe New Division\\n\\nand final reality; that in them, two realities of different\\nnatures had too long been confused.\\n\\nOn one hand, there was Poverty: scarcity of commodities and money, an economic situation linked to the state of\\ncommerce, of agriculture, of industry. On the other, there\\nwas Population: not a passive element subject to the fluctuations of wealth, but a force which directly contributed to\\nthe economic situation, to the production of wealth, since it\\nis man’s Jabor which creates—or at least transmits, shifts,\\nand multiplies—wealth. The “Poor Man”. was a vague notion in which were combined that wealth which is Man and\\nthe state of Need which is acknowledged as essential to\\nhumanity. Indeed, berween Poverty and Population, there\\nisa rigorously inverse relation.\\n\\nPhysiocrats and economists are in agreement on this.\\nPopulation is in itself one of the elements of wealth, ic\\nforms, indeed, its certain and inexhaustible source. For\\nFrangois Quesnay and his disciples, man is the essential\\nmediation between the land and wealth: “A man is worth\\nas much as the land, according to an old proverb. If a man\\nis valueless, so is the land. With men, one doubles the land\\none possesses; one clears it, one acquires it. God alone could\\nfrom the earth make a man, whereas all over the world it\\nhas been possible to have land by means of men, or at least\\nthe product of the land, which comes down to the same\\nthing. It follows that the first good is the possession of men,\\nand the second, of the land.”?\\n\\nFor the economists, the population is a good quite as\\nessential, if not more so, since in their view wealth is created not only in agricultural labor, but in every industrial\\ntransformation, and even in commercial circulation. Wealth\\nis linked to a labor actually effected by man: “The State\\nhaving real wealth only in the annual products of its lands\\nand in the industry of its inhabitants, its wealth will be at a\\n\\n(237)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c    \\n\\n \\n   \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nmaximam when the product of each acre of land and of the\\nindustry of each individual is raised to its maximum.”® Paradoxically, 2 population will be precious in proportion to\\nits numbers, since it will afford industry a cheap labor\\nforce, which, by lowering the cost price, will permit a development of production and of commerce. In this infinitely open labor market, the “fundamental price”—what\\ncorresponds for Turgot to the worker\\'s subsistence—and\\nthe price determined by supply and demand ultimately\\ncoincide. A nation will therefore be favored in commercial\\ncompetition to the degree that it has at its disposal the greatest potential wealth of a numerous population.\\n\\nConfinement was a gross error, and an economic mistake: poverty was to be suppressed by removing and maintaining by charity a poor population. Actually, it was\\npoverty that was being artificially masked; and a part of\\nthe population was being really suppressed, wealth being\\nalways constant. Was the intention to help the poor escape\\ntheir provisional indigence? They were kept from doing\\nso: the labor market was limited, which was all the more\\ndangerous in chat this was precisely a period of crisis. On\\nthe contrary, the high cost of products should have been\\npalliated by a cheap labor force, their scarcity being compensated by a new industrial and agricultural effort, The\\nonly reasonable remedy: to restore this entire population to\\nthe circuit of production, in order to distribute it to the\\npoints where the labor force was rarest. To utilize the\\npoor, vagabonds, exiles, and éyigrés of all kinds, was one of\\nthe secrets of wealth, in the competition among nations:\\n“What is the best means of weakening the neighboring\\nstates whose power and industry tend to overshadow us?”\\nasked Josias Tucker apropos of the emigration of the Protestants. “Is it to force their subjects to remain at home by\\nrefusing to receive and incorporate them among us, or is it\\n\\n(232)\\n\\x0c  \\n\\nThe New Division\\n\\nto attract them to us by good wages, allowing them to\\nenjoy the advantages of the other citizens?”\\n\\nConfinement is open to criticism because of the repercussions it can have on the labor market; but still more,\\nbecause it constitutes, and with it the entire enterprise of\\ntraditional charity, a dangerous financing. Like the Middle\\nAges, the classical period had always sought to provide aid\\nto the poor by the system of foundations. This meant that a\\nshare of land capital or income was thereby immobilized.\\nAnd for good, since, in the just concern to avoid the commercialization of the charity enterprises, all juridical measures were taken so that these goods would never return to\\ncirculation. But with the passage of time, their utility diminished; the economic situation changed, poverty altered\\nits aspect: “Society does not always have the same needs;\\nnature and the distribution of property, the division between the different orders of the people, the opinions, the\\ncustoms, the general occupations of the nation or of its\\ndifferent portions, the climate itself, the diseases and other\\naccidents of human life undergo a continual variation; new\\nneeds are born; others cease to make themselves felt.”® The\\ndefinitive character of the foundation was in contradiction\\nto the variable and indefinite rate of the accidental needs\\nwhich it was supposed to satisfy. Without the wealth\\nwhich it immobilized being restored to circulation, new\\nwealth had to be created as new needs appeared. The share\\nof funds and revenues which were set aside constantly increased, thereby diminishing the productive share. Which\\ninevitably led to a greater poverty, hence to more numerous foundations. And the process could extend indefinitely.\\nThe moment could come when “the ever multiplying\\nfoundations would ultimately absorb all funds and all private property.” Upon close scrutiny, the classical forms of\\naid were a cause of impoverishment, the gradual immobili\\n(233)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c   \\n\\n \\n   \\n\\nManvness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nzation and in a sense the slow death of all productive\\nwealth: “If ail the men who ever lived had had a tomb, ir\\nwould have been quite necessary, in order to find land to\\ncultivate, to overturn these sterile monuments, and to stir\\nthe ashes of the dead in order to feed the living.”\\n\\nWhat disappeared, in the course of the eighteenth century, was nor the inhuman rigor with which madmen were\\ntreated, but the evident necessity of confinement, the total\\nunity in which they were situated without difficulty, and\\nthose countless threads that wove them into che continuous\\ntexture of unreason. Madness was set free long before\\nPinel, not from the material constraints which kept it in the\\ndungeon, but from a much more binding, perhaps more\\ndecisive servitude which kept it under the domination of\\nunreason’s obscure power. Even before the Revolution,\\nmadness was free: free for a perception which individualized it, free for the recognition of its unique features and\\nfor all the operations that would finally give it its status as\\nan object.\\n\\nLeft alone, and detached from its former relations,\\nwithin the crumbling walls of confinement, madness was a\\nproblem~raising questions it had hitherto never formulated.\\n\\nAbove all, it embarrassed the legislator who, unable to\\nkeep from sanctioning the end of confinement, no longer\\nknew at what point in the social sphere to situate it—\\nprison, hospital, or family aid. The measures taken immediately before or after the beginning of the Revolution reflect this indecision.\\n\\nIn his circular on the lettres de cachet, Breteuil asked the\\nadministrators to indicate the nature of the detention orders\\nin the various houses of confinement, and what reasons justified them. After a year or two of detention at the most,\\nthose men were to be set free “who, having done nothing\\n\\n(234)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nment; they were simply thrown into prison. We may suppose that in certain important cities—centers of travel and\\nmarkets—madmen had been brought in considerable numbers by merchants and mariners and “lost” there, thus\\nridding their native cities of their presence. It may have\\nhappened that these places of “‘counterpilgrimage” have become confused with the places where, on the contrary, the\\ninsane were taken as pilgrims. Interest in cure and in exclusion coincide: madmen were confined in the holy locus of a\\nmiracle. It is possible that the village of Gheel developed in\\nthis manner—a shrine that became a ward, a holy land\\nwhere madness hoped for deliverance, but where man\\nenacted, according to old themes, a sort of ritual division.\\n\\nWhat matters is that the vagabond madmen, the act of\\ndriving them away, their departure and embarkation do not\\nassume their entire significance on the plane of social utility\\nor security. Other meanings much closer to rite are certainly present; and we can still discern some traces of them.\\nThus access to churches was denied to madmen, although\\necclesiastical law did not deny them the use of the sacraments. The Church takes no action against a priest who\\ngoes mad; but in Nuremberg in 1421 a mad priest was\\nexpelled with particular solemnity, as if the impurity was\\nmultiplied by the sacred nature of his person, and the city\\nput on its budget the money given him as a viaticum. It\\nhappened that certain madmen were publicly whipped, and\\nin the course of a kind of a game they were chased in a\\nmock race and driven out of the city with quarterstaff\\nblows. So many signs that the expulsion of madmen had\\nbecome one of a number of ritual exiles.\\n\\nThus we better understand the curious implication assigned to the navigation of madmen and the prestige attending it. On the one hand, we must not minimize its incontestable practical effectiveness: to hand a madman over to\\nsailors was to be permanently sure he would not be prowl\\n(10)\\n\\x0c The New Division\\n\\nthat could expose them to the severity of the punishments\\npronounced by the laws, had abandoned themselves to the\\nexcesses of libertinage, debauchery, and dissipation.” On\\nthe other hand, those prisoners were to be kept in the\\nhouses of confinement “whose minds are deranged and\\nwhose imbecility makes them incapable of conducting\\nthemselves in a world where their rages would make them\\ndangerous. With respect to these, all that is necessary is to\\nascertain whether their condition is still the same, and unfortunately it becomes indispensable to continue their detention as long as it is acknowledged that their freedom is\\nharmful to society, or a useless benefit to themselves.” This\\nwas the first stage: to reduce as much as possible the practice of confinement with regard to moral transgressions,\\nfamily conflicts, the most benign aspects of libertinage, yet\\nto leave it untouched in its principle, and with one of its\\nmajor meanings intact: the internment of the mad. This is\\nthe moment when madness actually takes possession of\\nconfinement, while confinement itself is divested of its\\nother forms of utility.\\n\\nThe second stage was that of the great investigations\\nprescribed by the National Assembly and by the Constituent Assembly, immediately following the Declaration of\\nthe Rights of Man: “No man may be arrested or detained\\nexcept in the cases determined by law and according to the\\nforms therein prescribed. . . . The law must permit only\\nthe penalties strictly and evidently necessary, and no one\\nmay be punished under a law established and promulgated\\nsubsequent to the crime.” The era of confinement was\\nover. There remained only an imprisonment shared for the\\nmoment by condemned or presumed criminals and the\\nmad. The Committee on Mendicity of the Constirutent Assembly designated five persons to visit the houses of confinement in Paris, The Duke de la Rochefoucauld-Liancourt presented the report (December 1789); he declared\\n\\n(235)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nthat the presence of madmen gave the houses of correction\\na degrading aspect and was likely to reduce the inmates to 2\\nstatus unworthy of humanity; the mélange tolerated there\\nproved a great frivolity on the part of the authorities and .\\nthe magistrates: “This carelessness is far from the enlightened and scrupulous pity for misfortune whereby it re\\nceives all possible alleviation and consolation . . . ; in seeking to succor poverty, can one ever consent to appear to\\ndegrade humanity?”\\n\\nIf the mad defile those with whom they have been imprudently confined, a special internment must be reserved\\nfor them; a confinement that is not medical, but that ought\\nto be the most efficacious and the easiest form of aid: “Of\\nall the misfortunes that afflict humanity, the condition of\\nmadness is still one of those that with most reason call for\\npity and respect; it is for this condition that our attentions\\nmust with most reason be prodigal; when there is no hope\\nof a cure, how many means sull remain that can afford\\nthese unfortunates at least a tolerable existence.” In. this\\ntext, the status of madness appears in all its ambiguity: it is\\nnecessary both to protect the confined population from its\\ndangers, and to grant it the benefits of a special aid.\\n\\nThe third stage was the great series of decrees issued\\nbetween the twelfth and the sixteenth of March 1790. In\\nthem, the Declaration of the Rights of Man received a concrete application: “In the space of six weeks, beginning\\nwith the present decree, all persons detained in fortresses,\\nreligious houses, houses of correction, police houses, or\\nother prisons whatsoever, by lettres de cachet or by order\\nof the agents of the executive power, so long as they are\\nnot convicted, or under arrest, or not charged with major\\ncrimes, or confined by reason of madness, will be set at\\nliberty.” Confinement is thus definitively reserved for certain categories of convicted criminals and for madmen. But\\nfor the latter, a special arrangement is in order: “Persons\\n\\n(236)\\n\\x0c The New Division\\n\\ndetained for reasons of dementia will be, for the space of\\nthree months, starting from the day of publication of the\\npresent decree, at the suit of our procurators, interrogated\\nby the magistrates in the usual manner, and by virtue of\\ntheir disposition visited by physicians. who, under the supervision of the directors of the district, will pronounce\\nupon the true circumstances of the patients in order that,\\nafter the sentence that will have certified as to their condition, they may be released or cared for in hospitals indicated for that purpose.” It appears that the choice is hence~\\nforth made. On March 29, 1790, Bailly, Duport-Dutertre,\\nand a police administrator went to La Salpétriére to determine in what manner this decree could be carried out; they\\nthen made a similar visit to Bicétre. The difficulties were\\nnumerous; to begin with, there existed no hospitals intended or at least reserved for the mad.\\n\\nIn the face of these material difficulties, to which were\\nadded certain theoretical uncertainties, a long phase of hesitation was to begin. From all sides, the Assembly was asked\\nto provide a text which would grant protection from madmen even before the promised creation of the hospitals.\\nAnd by a regression, which was to be of great importance\\nfor the future, madmen were brought under the sway of\\nimmediate and unchecked measures adopted not even\\nagainst dangerous criminals, but against marauding beasts.\\nThe Law of August 16-24, 1790, “entrusts to the vigilance\\nand authority of the municipal bodies . . . the care of abviating and remedying the disagreeable events that may be\\noccasioned by madmen set at liberty, and by the wandering of vicious and dangerous animals.” The law of July 22,\\n1791, reinforces this arrangement, making families responsible for the supervision of the insane, and permitting the\\nmunicipal authorities to take all measures that might prove\\nuseful: “The relatives of the insane must care for them,\\nprevent them from straying, and see that they do not\\n\\n(237)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c   \\n\\n    \\n\\nMavneEss & CIVILIZATION\\n\\ncommit offenses or disorders. The municipal authority\\nmust obviate the inconvenience that may result from the\\nnegligence with which private persons fulfill this duty.” By\\nthis detour around their liberation, madmen regained, but\\nthis time within the law itself, that animal status in which\\nconfinement had seemed to isolate them; they again became\\nwild beasts at the very period when doctors began to attribute to them a gentle animality. But even though this\\nlegal disposition was put in the hands of the authorities, the\\nproblems were not solved thereby; hospitals for the insane\\nstill did not exist.\\n\\nCountless requests flooded the Ministry of the Interior.\\nDelessart answered one of them, for example: “I feel as you\\ndo, Monsieur, how important it is that we labor without\\nrespite toward the establishment of houses designed to\\nserve as retreats for the unfortunate class of the insane.\\n. .. With regard to those insane persons whom the lack\\nof such an establishment has relegated to the various prisons of your department, I do not see any other means at\\npresent of removing them from those places so unsuited to\\ntheir state, except to transfer them temporarily, if possible, to Bicétre. It would therefore be appropriate for the\\nDirectory to write to the Paris establishment in order to\\nascertain a way to have them admitted to that house, where\\nthe costs of their upkeep will be paid by your department\\nor by the communes where these unfortunates reside, if\\ntheir families are not in a position to assume that expense.”\\nBicétre thus became the great center to which all che insane\\n‘were sent, especially once Saint-Lazare was closed. The\\nsame was true for the women at La Salpétriére: in 1792,\\ntwo hundred madwomen were taken there who had been\\ninstalled five years previously in the former novitiate of the\\nCapucines on the Rue Saint-Jacques. But in the remote\\nprovinces, there was no question of sending the insane to\\nthe former bépitaux généraux. Generally, they were de\\n(238)\\n\\x0c The New Division\\n\\ntained in the prisons, as was the case for example at the\\nfortress of Ha, at the Chateau of Angers, or at Bellevaux.\\nThe disorder in such places was indescribable, and continved for a long time—until the Empire. Antoine Nodier\\ngives some details about Bellevaux: “Every day, the uproar\\nwarns the neighborhood that those confined are fighting\\nand persecuting one another. The guards rush upon them.\\nConstituted as they are today, the prison guards are the\\nlaughingstock of the combatants. The municipal administrators are implored to intervene in order to re-establish\\npeace and quiet; their authority is flouted; they are shamed\\nand insulted; this is no longer a house of justice and detention.”\\n\\nThe disorders are as great, greater perhaps, at Bicétre;\\npolitical prisoners are kept there; hunted suspects are hidden there; poverty and famine keep many people hungry.\\nThe administration never ceases to protest; it asks that\\ncriminals be kept separate; and—it is important to note—\\nsome people still suggest that, in their place of detention,\\nmadmen be confined as well. On the ninth Brumaire, Year\\nTl, the bursar of Bicétre writes to “Citizens Grandpré\\nand Osmond, members of the Committee on Administration and Tribunals”: “I submit that at a2 moment when\\nhumanity is decidedly the order of the day, there is no one\\nwho does not experience an impulse of horror upon seeing\\ncrime and indigence united in the same asylum.” Was ic\\nnecessary to recall the September massacres, the continual\\nescapes, and, for so many innocent eyes, the sight of\\nstrangled prisoners, of swinging chains? The indigent and\\nthe old “have before their eyes nothing but chains, bars,\\nand bolts. Add to this the groans of the prisoners that\\nsometimes reach them. . . . It is on this basis that I urgently ask either that the prisoners be removed from Bicétre, leaving only the indigent there, or that the indigent\\nbe removed, leaving only the prisoners.” And here, finally,\\n\\n(239)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c   \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nManvNneEss & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nis the decisive point, if we remember that this letter was\\nwritten in the middle of the Revolution, long before the\\nreports of Georges Cabanis, and several months after Pinel,\\naccording to tradition, had “liberated” the insane of Bicécre:\\n“We could perhaps in this latter case leave the madmen\\nthere, another class of unfortunates who cause horrible\\nsuffering to humanity. . . . Make haste, then, citizens who\\ncherish humanity, to realize such a beautiful dream, and be\\npersuaded in advance that you will thereupon have deserved\\nwell of it.” So great was the confusion of those years; so\\ndifficult was it, at the moment when “humanity” was being\\nre-evaluated, to determine the place madness was to occupy\\nwithin it; so difficulr was it to situate madness in a social\\nsphere that was being restructured.\\n\\n(240)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c IX\\n\\noe\\n\\nTHE BIRTH OF\\nTHE ASYLUM\\n\\nWe know the images. They are familiar in all histories of\\npsychiatry, where their function is to illustrate that happy\\nage when madness was finally recognized and treated according to a truth to which we had too long remained blind.\\n\\n“The worthy Society of Friends . . . sought to assure\\nthose of its members who might have the misfortune to lose\\ntheir reason without a sufficient fortune to resort to expensive establishments all the resources of medicine and all the\\ncomforts of life compatible with their state; a voluntary\\nsubscription furnished the funds, and for the last two years,\\nan establishment that seems to unite many advantages with\\nall possible economy has been founded near the city of\\nYork. If the soul momentarily quails at the sight of that\\ndread disease which seems created to humiliate human reason, it subsequently experiences gentler emotions when it\\n\\n(247)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMADNESS & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nconsiders all that an ingenious benevolence has been able to\\ninvent for its care and cure.\\n\\n“This house is situated a mile from York, in the midst of\\na fertile and smiling countryside; it is not at all the idea of a\\nprison that it suggests, but rather that of a large farm; it is\\nsurrounded by a great, walled garden. No bars, no grilles\\non the windows.”?\\n\\nAs for the liberation of the insane at Bicétre, the story is\\nfamous: the decision to remove the chains from the prisoners in the dungeons; Couthon visiting the hospital to find\\nout whether any suspects were being hidden; Pinel courageously going to meet him, while everyone trembled at\\nthe sight of the “invalid carried in men’s arms.” The confrontation of the wise, firm philanthropist and the paralytic\\nmonster. “Pinel immediately led him to the section for the\\nderanged, where the sight of the cells made a painful impression on him. He asked to interrogate all the patients.\\nFrom most, he received only insults and obscene apostrophes. It was useless to prolong the interview. Turning to\\nPinel: ‘Now, citizen, are you mad yourself to seek to unchain such beasts?’ Pinel replied calmly: ‘Citizen, I am\\nconvinced that these madmen are so intractable only because they have been deprived of air and Liberty.’\\n\\n“Well, do as you like with them, but I fear you may\\nbecome the victim of your own presumption.’ Whereupon,\\nCouthon was taken to his carriage. His departure was a\\nrelief; everyone breathed again; the great philanthropist\\nimmediately set to work.”?\\n\\nThese are images, at least insofar as each of the stories\\nderives the essence of its power from imaginary forms: the\\npatriarchal calm of Tuke’s home, where the heart\\'s passions\\nand the mind’s disorders slowly subside; the lucid firmness\\nof Pinel, who masters in a word and a gesture the two\\nanimal frenzies that roar against him as they hunt him\\ndown; and the wisdom that could distinguish, between the\\n\\n(242)\\n\\x0c The Birth of the Asylum\\n\\nraving madman and the bloodthirsty member of the Convention, which was the true danger: images that will carry\\nfar—to our own day—their weight of legend.\\n\\nThe legends of Pinel and Tuke transmit mythical values,\\nwhich nineteenth-century psychiatry would accept as obvious in nature. But beneath the myths themselves, there\\nwas an operation, or rather a series of operations, which\\nsilently organized the world of the asylum, the methods of\\ncure, and at the same time the concrete experience of madness.\\n\\nTuke’s gesture, first of all. Because it is contemporary\\nwith Pinel’s, because he is known to have been borne along\\nby a whole current of “philanthropy,” this gesture is regarded as an act of “liberation.” The truth was quite different: . . . there has also been particular occasion to observe the great loss, which individuals of our society have\\nsustained, by being put under the care of those who are not\\nonly strangers to our principles, but by whom they are\\nfrequently mixed with other patients, who may indulge\\nthemselves in ill Janguage, and other exceptionable prac~\\ntices. This often seems to leave an unprofitable effect upon\\nthe patients’ minds after they are restored to the use of\\ntheir reason, alienating them from those religious attachments which they had before experienced; and sometimes,\\neven corrupting them with vicious habits to which they\\nhad been strangers.”* The Retreat would serve as an instrument of segregation: a moral and religious segregation\\nwhich sought to reconstruct around madness a milieu as\\nmuch as possible like that of the Community of Quakers.\\nAnd this for two reasons: first, the sight of evil is for every\\nsensitive soul the cause of suffering, the origin of all those\\nstrong and untoward passions such as horror, hate, and digust which engender or perpetuate madness: “It was\\nthought, very justly, that the indiscriminate mixture, which\\n\\n(243)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nmust occur in large public establishments, of persons of\\nopposite religious sentiments and practices; of the profligate\\nand the virtuous; the profane and the serious; was calculated to check the progress of returning reason, and to fix,\\nstill deeper, the melancholy and misanthropic train of\\nideas . . .”* But the principal reason lies elsewhere: it is\\nthat religion can play the double role of nature and of rule,\\nsince it has assumed the depth of nature in ancestral habie,\\nin education, in everyday exercise, and since it is at the\\nsame time a constant principle of coercion. It is both spontaneity and constraint, and to this degree it controls the\\nonly forces that can, in reason’s eclipse, counterbalance the\\nmeasureless violence of madness; its precepts, “where these\\nhave been strongly imbued in early life . . . become lictle\\nless than principles of our nature; and their restraining\\npower is frequently felt, even under the delirious excitement of insanity. To encourage the influence of religious\\nprinciples over the mind of the insane is considered of great\\nconsequence, as a means of cure.”* In the dialectic of insanity where reason hides without abolishing itself, religion\\nconstitutes the concrete form of what cannot go mad; it\\nbears what is invincible in reason, it bears what subsists beneath madness as quasi-nature and around it as the constant\\nsolicitation of a milieu “where, during lucid intervals, or\\nthe state of convalescence, the patient might enjoy the society of those who were of similar habits and opinions.”\\nReligion safeguards the old secret of reason in the presence\\nof madness, thus making closer, more immediate, the constraint that was already rampant in classical confinement.\\nThere, the religious and moral milieu was imposed from\\nwithout, in such a way that madness was controlled, not\\ncured. At the Retreat, religion was part of the movement\\nwhich indicated in spite of everything the presence of reason in madness, and which led from insanity to health. Religious segregation has a very precise meaning: it does not\\n\\n(244)\\n\\x0c     \\n\\n  \\n\\n“Stultifera Navis”\\n\\ning beneath the city walls; it made sure that he would go\\nfar away; it made him a prisoner of his own departure. But\\nwater adds to this the dark mass of its own values; it carries\\noff, but it does more: it purifies. Navigation delivers man to\\nthe uncertainty of fate; on water, each of us is in the hands\\nof his own destiny; every embarkation is, potentially, the\\nlast. It is for the other world that the madman sets sail in\\nhis fools’ boat; it is from the other world that he comes\\nwhen he disembarks. The madman’s voyage is at once a\\nrigorous division and an absolute Passage. In one sense, it\\nsimply develops, across a half-real, half-imaginary geography, the madman’s Hminal position on the horizon of\\nmedieval concern—a position symbolized and made real at\\nthe same time by the madman’s privilege of being confined\\nwithin the city gates: his exclusion must enclose him; if he\\ncannot and must not have another prison than the threshold itself, he is kept at the point of passage. He is put in the\\ninterior of the exterior, and inversely, A highly symbolic\\nposition, which will doubtless remain his until our own\\nday, if we are willing to admit that what was formerly a\\nvisible fortress of order has now become the castle of our\\nconscience.\\n\\nWater and navigation certainly play this role. Confined\\non the ship, from which there is no escape, the madman is.\\ndelivered to the river with its thousand arms, the sea with\\nits thousand roads, to that great uncertainty external to\\neverything. He is a prisoner in the midst of what is the\\nfreest, the openest of routes: bound fast at the infinite\\ncrossroads, He is the Passenger par excellence: that is, the\\nprisoner of the passage. And the land he will come to is\\nunknown-~as is, once he disembarks, the land from which\\nhe comes. He has his truth and his homeland only in that\\nfruitless expanse between two countries that cannot belong\\nto him. Is it this ritual and these values which are at the\\norigin of the long imaginary relationship that can be traced\\n\\n(ie)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c The Birth of the Asylum\\n\\nattempt to preserve the sufferers from the profane presence\\nof non-Quakers, but to place the insane individual within a\\nmoral element where he will be in debate with himself and\\nhis surroundings: to constitute for him a milieu where, far\\nfrom being protected, he will be kept in a perpetual anxiety, ceaselessly threatened by Law and Transgression.\\n\\n“The principle of fear, which is rarely decreased by insanity, is considered as of great importance in the management of the patients.”* Fear appears as an essential presence\\nin the asylum. Already an ancient figure, no doubt, if we\\nthink of the terrors of confinement. But these terrors surrounded madness from the outside, marking the boundary\\nof reason and unreason, and enjoying a double power: over\\nthe violence of fury in order to contain it, and over reason\\nitself to hold it at a distance; such fear was entirely on the\\nsurface. The fear instituted at the Retreat is of great depth;\\nit passes between reason and madness like a mediation, like\\nan evocation of a common nature they still share, and by\\nwhich it could link them together. The terror that once\\nreigned was the most visible sign of the alienation of madness in the classical period; fear was now endowed with a\\npower of disalienation, which permitted it to restore a\\nprimitive complicity between the madman and the man of\\nreason. It re-established a solidarity between them. Now\\nmadness would never—could never—cause fear again; it\\nwould be afraid, without recourse or return, thus entirely\\nin the hands of the pedagogy of good sense, of truth, and\\nof morality.\\n\\nSamuel Tuke tells how he received at the Retreat a\\nmaniac, young and prodigiously strong, whose seizures\\ncaused panic in those around him and even among his\\nguards. When he entered rhe Retreat he was loaded with\\nchains; he wore handcuffs; his clothes were attached by\\nropes. He had no sooner arrived than all his shackles were\\nremoved, and he was permitted to dine with the keepers;\\n\\n(245)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nhis agitation immediately ceased; “his attention appeared to\\n. be arrested by his new situation.” He was taken to his room;\\nthe keeper explained that the entire house was organized in\\nterms of the greatest liberty and the greatest comfort for\\nall, and that he would not be subject to any constraint so\\nlong as he did nothing against the rules of the house or the\\ngeneral principles of human morality. For his part, the\\nkeeper declared he had no desire to use the means of coercion at his disposal. “The maniac was sensible of the kindness of his treatment. He promised to restrain himself.” He\\nsometimes still raged, shouted, and frightened his companions. The keeper reminded him of the threats and promises\\n\"of the first day; if he did not control himself, it would be\\nnecessary to go back to the old ways. The patient’s agitation would then increase for a while, and then rapidly decline. “He would listen with attention to the persuasions\\nand arguments of his friendly visitor. After such conversations, the patient was generally better for some days or a\\nweek.” At the end of four months, he left the Retreat,\\nentirely cured. Here fear is addressed to the invalid directly, not by instruments but in speech; there is no question of limiting a liberty that rages beyond its bounds, but\\nof marking out and glorifying a region of simple responsibility where any manifestation of madness will be linked to\\npunishment. The obscure guilt that once linked transgression and unreason is thus shifted; the madman, as 2 human\\nbeing originally endowed with reason, is no longer guilty\\nof being mad; buc the madman, as a madman, and in the\\ninterior of that disease of which he is no longer guilty, must\\nfeel morally responsible for everything within him chat\\nmay disturb morality and society, and must hold no one\\nbut himself responsible for the punishment he receives. The\\nassignation of guilt is no longer the mode of relation that\\nobtains between the madman and the sane man in their\\ngenerality; it becomes both the concrete form of coexist\\n(246)\\n\\x0c The Birth of the Asylum\\n\\nence of each madman with his keeper, and the form of\\nawareness that the madman must have of his own madness.\\n\\nWe must therefore re-evaluate the meanings assigned to\\nTuke’s work: liberation of the insane, abolition of constraint, constitution of a human milieu—these are only\\njustifications. The real operations were different. In fact\\nTuke created an asylum where he substituted for the free\\nterror of madness the stifling anguish of responsibility; fear\\nno longer reigned on the other side of the prison gates, it\\nnow raged under the seals of conscience. Tuke now transferred the age-old terrors in which the insane had been\\ntrapped to the very heart of madness. The asylum no\\nlonger punished the madman’s guilt, it is true; but it did\\nmore, it organized that guilt; it organized it for the madman\\nas 2 consciousness of himself, and as a non-reciprocal relation to the keeper; it organized it for the man of reason as\\nan awareness of the Other, a therapeutic intervention in the\\nmadman’s existence. In other words, by this guilt the madman became an object of punishment always vulnerable to\\nhimself and to the Other; and, from the acknowledgment\\nof his status as object, from the awareness of his guilt, the\\nmadman was to return to his awareness of himself as a free\\nand responsible subject, and consequently to reason, This\\nmovement by which, objectifying himself for the Other,\\nthe madman thus returned to his liberty, was to be found as\\nmuch in Work as in Observation.\\n\\nLet us not forget that we are in a Quaker world where\\nGod blesses men in the signs of their prosperity. Work\\ncomes first in “moral treatment” as practiced at the Retreat.\\nIn itself, work possesses a constraining power superior to all\\nforms of physical coercion, in that the regularity of the\\nhours, the requirements of attention, the obligation to produce a result detach the sufferer from a liberty of mind that\\nwould be fatal and engage him in a system of responsibilities: “Regular employment is perhaps the most generally\\n\\n(247)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nefficacious; and those kinds of employment are doubtless to\\nbe preferred, both on a moral and physical account, which\\nare accompanied by considerable bodily action; that are\\nmost agreeable to the patient and which are most opposite\\nto the illusions of his disease.”? Through work, man returns to the order of God’s commandments; he submits his\\nliberty to laws.that are those of both morality and reality.\\nHence mental work is not to be rejected; yet with absolute\\nrigor, all exercises of the imagination must be excluded as\\nbeing in complicity with the passions, the desires, or all\\ndelirious illusions. On the contrary, the study of what is\\neternal in nature and most in accord with the wisdom and\\ngoodness of Providence has the greatest efficacity in reducing the madman’s immoderate liberties and bringing him to\\ndiscover the forms of his responsibility. “The various\\nbranches of the mathematics and natural science furnish the\\nmost useful class of subjects on which to employ the minds\\nof the insane.” In the asylum, work is deprived of any\\nproductive value; it is imposed only as 2 moral rule; a limitation of liberty, a submission to order, an engagement of\\nresponsibility, with the single aim of disalienating the mind\\nlost in the excess of a liberty which physical constraint\\nlimits only in appearance.\\n\\nEven more efficacious than work, than the observation\\nof others, is what Tuke calls “the need for esteem”: “This\\nprinciple in the human mind, which doubtless influences in\\na great degree, though often secretly, our general manners;\\nand which operates with peculiar force on our introduction\\ninto a new circle of acquaintance.” In classical confinement,\\nthe madman was also vulnerable to observation, but such\\nobservation did not, basically, involve him; it involved only\\nhis monstrous surface, his visible animality; and ic included\\nat least one form of reciprocity, since the sane man could\\nread in the madman, as in a mirror, the imminent movement\\nof his downfall. The observation Tuke now instituted as\\n\\n(248)\\n\\x0c The Birth of the Asylum\\n\\none of the great elements of asylum existence was both\\ndeeper and less reciprocal. It pursued in the madman the\\nleast perceptible signs of his madness, in the place where\\nmadness becomes secretly distinct from reason, begins to\\ndetach itself from it; and the madman cannot return this\\nobservation in any form, since he is merely observed; he is\\na kind of new arrival, a latecomer in the world of reason.\\nTuke organized an entire ceremonial around these observa~\\ntions. There were social occasions in the English manner,\\nwhere everyone was obliged to imitate all the formal requirements of social existence; nothing else circulated except the observation that would spy out any incongruity,\\nany disorder, any awkwardness where madness might betray itself. The directors and staff of the Retreat thus regularly invited several patients to “‘tea-parties”; the guests\\n“dress in their best clothes, and vie with each other in politeness and propriety, The best fare is provided, and the\\nvisitors are treated with all the attention of strangers. The\\nevening generally passes with the greatest harmony and\\nenjoyment. It rarely happens that any unpleasant circumstance occurs; the patients control, to a wonderful degree,\\ntheir different propensities; and the scene is at once curious\\nand affectingly gratifying.” Curiously, this rite is not one of\\nintimacy, of dialogue, of mutual acquaintance; it is the organization around the madman of a world where everything would be like and near him, but in which he himself\\nwould remain a stranger, the Stranger par excellence who is\\njudged not only by appearances but by all that they may\\nbetray and reveal in spite of themselves. Incessantly cast in\\nthis empty role of unknown visitor, and challenged in\\neverything that can be known about him, drawn to the\\nsurface of himself by a social personality silently imposed\\nby observation, by form and mask, the madman is obliged\\nto objectify himself in the eyes of reason as the perfect\\nstranger, that is, as the man whose strangeness does not\\n\\n(249)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nManpness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nreveal itself. The city of reason welcomes him only with\\nthis qualification and at the price of this surrender to\\nanonymity.\\n\\nWe see that at the Retreat the partial suppression of\\nphysical constraint was part of a system whose essential\\nelement was the constitution of a “self-restraine” in which\\nthe patient’s freedom, engaged by work and the observation of others, was ceaselessly threatened by the recognition of guilt. Instead of submitting to a simple negative\\noperation that loosened bonds and delivered one’s deepest\\nnature from madness, it must be recognized that one was in\\nthe grip of a positive operation that confined madness in a\\nsystem of rewards and punishments, and included it in the\\nmovement of moral consciousness. A passage from a world\\nof Censure to a universe of Judgment. But thereby a psychology of madness becomes possible, for under observation madness is constantly required, at the surface of itself,\\nto deny its dissimulation. It is judged only by its acts; it is\\nnot accused of intentions, nor are its secrets to be fathomed. Madness is responsible only for that part of itself\\nwhich is visible. All the rest is reduced to silence. Madness\\nno longer exists except as seen. The proximity instiruted by\\nthe asylum, an intimacy neither chains nor bars would ever\\nviolate again, does not allow reciprocity: only the nearness\\nof observation that watches, that spies, that comes closer in\\norder to see better, but moves ever farther away, since it\\naccepts and acknowledges only the values of the Stranger.\\nThe science of mental disease, as it would develop in the asylum, would always be only of the order of observation and\\nclassification, It would not be a dialogue. It could not be\\nthat until psychoanalysis had exorcised this phenomenon of\\nobservation, essential to the nineteenth-century asylum.\\nand substituted for its silent magic the powers of language.\\nIt would be fairer to say that psychoanalysis doubled the\\nabsolute observation of the watcher with the endless mono\\n(250)\\n\\x0c The Birth of the Asylum\\n\\nlogue of the person watched—thus preserving the old asylum structure of non-reciprocal observation but balancing\\nit, in a non-symmetrical reciprocity, by the new structure\\nof language without response.\\n\\nSurveillance and Judgment: already the outline appears\\nof a new personage who will be essential in the nineteenthcentury asylum. Tuke himself suggests this personage,\\nwhen he tells the story of a maniac subject to seizures of\\nirrepressible violence. One day while he was walking in the\\ngarden of the asylum with the keeper, this patient suddenly\\nentered a phase of excitation, moved several steps away,\\npicked up a large stone, and made the gesture of throwing\\nit at his companion. The keeper stopped, looked the patient\\nin the eyes; then advanced several steps toward him and “in\\na resolute tone of voice . . . commanded him to lay down\\nthe stone”; as he approached, the patient lowered his hand,\\nthen dropped his weapon; “he then submitted to be quietly\\nled to his apartment.” Something had been born, which\\nwas no longer repression, but authority. Until the end of\\nthe eighteenth century, the world of madmen was peopled\\nonly by the abstract, faceless power which kept them confined; within these limits, it was empty, empty of all that\\nwas not madness itself; the guards were often recruited\\namong the inmates themselves. Tuke established, on the\\ncontrary, a mediating element between guards and patients,\\nbetween reason and madness. The space reserved by society for insanity would now be haunted by those who were\\n“from the other side” and who represented both the prestige of the authority that confines and the rigor of the\\nreason that judges. The keeper intervenes, without weapons, without instruments of constraint, with observation\\nand language only; he advances upon madness, deprived of\\nall that could protect him or make him seem threatening,\\nrisking an immediate confrontation without recourse. In\\nfact, though, it is not as a concrete person that he confronts\\n\\n(2s7)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nmadness, but as a reasonable being, invested by that very\\nfact, and before any combat takes place, with the authority\\nthat is his for not being mad. Reason’s victory over unreason was once assured only by material force, and in a sort\\nof real combat. Now the combat was always decided beforehand, unreason’s defeat inscribed in advance in the\\nconcrete situation where madman and man of reason meet.\\nThe absence of constraint in the nineteenth-century asylum is not unreason liberated, but madness long since mastered,\\n\\nFor this new reason which reigns in the asylum, madness\\ndoes not represent the absolute form of contradiction, but\\ninstead a minority status, an aspect of itself that does not\\nhave the right to autonomy, and can live only grafted onto\\nthe world of reason. Madness is childhood. Everything at\\nthe Retreat is organized so that the insane are transformed\\ninto minors. They are regarded “‘as children who have an\\noverabundance of strength and make dangerous use of it.\\nThey must be given immediate punishments and rewards;\\nwhatever is remote has no effect on them. A new system of\\neducation must be applied, a new direction given to their\\nideas; they must first be subjugated, then encouraged, then\\napplied to work, and this work made agreeable by attractive means.” For a long time already, the law had regarded\\nthe insane as minors, but this was a juridical situation, abstractly defined by interdiction and trusteeship; it was not a\\nconcrete mode of relation between man and man. Minority\\nstatus became for Tuke a style of existence to be applied to\\nthe mad, and for the guards a mode of sovereignty. Great\\nemphasis was placed on the concept of the “family” which\\norganized the community of the insane and their keepers at\\nthe Retreat. Apparently this “family” placed the patient in\\na milieu both normal and natural; in reality it alienated him\\nstill more: the juridical minority assigned to the madman\\nwas intended to protect him as a subject of law; this ancient\\n\\n(252)\\n\\x0c The Birth of the Asylum\\n\\nstructure, by becoming a form of coexistence, delivered\\nhim entirely, as a psychological subject, to the authority\\nand prestige of the man of reason, who assumed for him the\\nconcrete figure of an adult, in other words, both domination and destination.\\n\\nIn the great reorganization of relations between madness\\nand reason, the family, at the end of the eighteenth century, played a decisive part—simultaneously imaginary landscape and real social structure; it is from the family that\\nTuke starts out, and toward it that he progresses. Lending\\nit the prestige of primitive values not yet compromised in\\nthe social, Tuke makes the family play a role of disalienation; it was, in his myth, the antithesis of that “milieu”\\nwhich the eighteenth century saw as the origin of all madness. But he introduced it as well, in a very real way, into\\nthe world of the asylum, where it appears both as truth and\\nas norm for all relations that may obtain between the madman and the man of reason. Thus minority under family\\ntutelage, a juridical status in which the madman’s civil status\\nis alienated, becomes a concrete situation in which his concrete liberty is alienated. The entire existence of madness,\\nin the world now being prepared for it, was enveloped in\\nwhat we may call, in anticipation, a “parental complex.”\\nThe prestige of patriarchy is revived around madness in the\\nbourgeois family. It is this historical sedimentation which\\npsychoanalysis would later bring to light, according it\\nthrough a new myth the meaning of a destiny that supposedly marked all of Western culture and perhaps all civilization, whereas it had been slowly deposited by it and\\nonly solidified quite recently at the turn of this century,\\nwhen madness was doubly alienated within the family—by\\nthe myth of a disalienation in patriarchal purity, and by 2\\ntruly alienating situation in an asylum constituted in the\\nfamily mode. Henceforth, and for a period of time the end\\nof which it is not yet possible to predict, the discourse of\\n\\n(253)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nManvness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nunreason will be indissociably linked with the half-real, halfimaginary dialectic of the Family. So that what, in their\\nviolence, it was once obligatory to interpret as profanations\\n‘or blasphemies, it would henceforth be necessary to see as\\nan incessant attack against the Father. Thus in the modern\\nworld, what had been the great, irreparable confrontation\\nof reason and unreason became the secret thrust of instincts\\nagainst the solidity of the family instirution and against its\\nmost archaic symbols.\\n\\nThere is an astonishing convergence of the movement of\\nfundamental institutions and this evolution of madness in\\nthe world of confinement. The liberal economy, as we have\\nseen, tended to entrust the care of the poor and the sick to\\nthe family rather than to the State: the family thus became\\nthe site of social responsibility. But if the patient can be\\nentrusted to the family, he is nonetheless mad, which is too\\nstrange and inhuman. Tuke, precisely, reconstitutes around\\nmadness a simulated family, which is an institutional parody but a real psychological situation. Where the family is\\ninadequate, he substitutes for it a fictitious family decor of\\nsigns and attitudes. But by a very curious intersection, the\\nday would come when the family was relieved of its responsibility to care for the patient in general, while it kept\\nthe fictitious values that concern madness; and long after\\nthe diseases of the poor had again become an affair of state,\\nthe asylum would keep the insane in the imperative fiction\\nof the family; the madman remains a minor, and for a long\\ntime reason will retain for him the aspect of the Father.\\n\\nClosed upon these fictitious values, the asylum was protected from history and from social evolution. In Tuke’s\\nmind, the problem was to constitute a milieu which would\\nimitate the oldest, the purest, the most natural forms of\\ncoexistence; the most human milieu possible, while being\\nthe least social one possible. In fact, he isolated the social\\nstructure of the bourgeois family, reconsticuted it symbol\\n(254)\\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nthrough the whole of Western culture? Or is it, conversely, this relationship that, from time immemorial, has\\ncalled into being and established the rite of embarkation?\\nOne thing at least is certain: water and madness have long\\nbeen linked in the dreams of European man,\\n\\nAlready, disguised as 2 madman, Tristan had ordered\\nboatmen to land him on the coast of Cornwall. And when\\nhe arrived at the castle of King Mark, no one recognized\\nhim, no one knew whence he had come. But he made too\\nmany strange remarks, both familiar and distant; he knew\\ntoo well the secrets of the commonplace not to have been\\nfrom another, yet nearby, world. He did not come from the\\nsolid land, with its solid cities; but indeed from the ceaseless\\nunrest of the sea, from those unknown highways which\\nconceal so much strange knowledge, from that fantastic\\nplain, the underside of the world. Iseut, first of all, realized\\nthat this madman was a son of the sea, and that insolent\\nsailors had cast him here, a sign of misfortune: “Accursed\\nbe the sailors that brought this madman! Why did they not\\nthrow him into the sea!”* And more than once in the\\ncourse of time, the same theme reappears: among the mystics of the fifteenth century, it has become the motif of the _\\nsoul as a skiff, abandoned on the infinite sea of desires, in\\nthe sterile field of cares and ignorance, among the mirages\\nof knowledge, amid the unreason of the world—a craft at\\nthe mercy of the sea’s great madness, unless it throws out a\\nsolid anchor, faith, or raises its spiritual sails so that the\\nbreath of God may bring it to port. At the end of the\\nsixteenth century, De Lanere sees in the sea the origin of\\nthe demoniacal leanings of an entire people: the hazardous\\nlabor of ships, dependence on the stars, hereditary secrets,\\nestrangement from women—the very image of the great,\\nturbulent plain itself makes man lose faith in God and all\\nhis attachment to his home; he is then in the hands of the\\nDevil, in the sea of Satan’s ruses.* In the classical period,\\n\\n(72)\\n\\x0c The Birth of the Asylum\\n\\nically in the asylum, and set it adrife in history. The asylum, always oriented to anachronistic structures and symbols, would be, par excellence, inadapted and out of time.\\nAnd exactly where animality manifested a presence without history, an eternal return, would slowly reappear the\\nimmemorial scars of old hatreds, old family profanations,\\nthe forgotten signs of incest and punishment.\\n\\nPinel advocates no religious segregation. Or rather, a\\nsegregation that functions in the opposite direction from\\nthat practiced by Tuke. The benefits of the renovated asylum were offered to all, or almost all, except the fanatics\\n“who believe themselves inspired and seek to make converts.” Bicétre and La Salpétritre, according to Pinel’s intention, form a complementary figure co the Retreat.\\n\\nReligion must not be the moral substratum of life in the\\nasylum, but purely and simply a medical object: “Religious\\nopinions in a hospital for the insane must be considered only\\nin a strictly medical relation, that is, one must set aside all\\nother considerations of public worship and political belief,\\nand investigate only whether it is necessary to oppose the\\nexaltation of ideas and feelings that may originate in this\\nsource, in order to effect the cure of certain alienated\\nminds.”® A source of strong emotions and terrifying images which it arouses through fears of the Beyond, Catholicism frequently provokes madness; it generates delirious\\nbeliefs, entertains hallucinations, leads men to despair and\\nto melancholia. We must not be surprised if, “examining\\nthe registers of the insane asylum at Bicétre, we find inscribed there many priests and monks, as well as country\\npeople maddened by a frightening picture of the future.”\\nSull less surprising is it to see the number of religious madnesses vary. Under the Old Regime and during the Revolution, the strength of superstitious beliefs, or the violence of\\nthe struggles in which the Republic opposed the Catholic\\n\\n(255)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavwness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nChurch, multiplied melancholias of religious origin. With\\nthe return of peace, the Concordat having erased the\\nstruggles, these forms of delirium disappeared; in the Year\\nX, so per cent of the melancholics in Bicétre were suffering\\nfrom religious madness, 33 per cent the following year, and\\nonly 18 per cent in the Year XIL. The asylum must thus be\\nfreed from religion and from all its iconographic connections; “‘melancholics by devotion” must not be allowed\\ntheir pious books; experience “teaches that this is the surest\\nmeans of perpetuating insanity or even of making it incurable, and the more such permission is granted, the less\\n‘we manage to calm anxiety and scruples.” Nothing takes us\\nfurther from Tuke and his dreams of a religious community that would at the same time be a privileged site of\\nmental cures, than this notion of a neutralized asylum, purified of those images and passions to which Christianity gave\\nbirth and which made the mind wander toward illusion,\\ntoward error, and soon toward delirium and hallucinations,\\n\\nBur Pinel’s problem was to reduce the iconographic\\nforms, not the moral content of religion. Once “filtered,”\\nreligion possesses a disalienating power that dissipates the\\nimages, calms the passions, and restores man to what is most\\nimmediate and essential: it can bring him closer to his moral\\ntruth. And it is here that religion is often capable of effecting cures. Pinel relates several Voltairean stories. One, for\\nexample, of a woman of twenty-five, “of strong constitution, united in wedlock to a weak and delicate man”; she\\nsuffered “quite violent fits of hysteria, imagining she was\\npossessed by a demon who followed her in different shapes,\\nsometimes emitting bird noises, sometimes mournful sounds\\nand piercing cries.” Happily, the local curé was more concerned with natural religion than learned in the techniques\\nof exorcism; he believed in curing through the benevolence\\not nature; this “enlightened man, of kindly and persuasive\\ncharacter, gained ascendancy over the patienc’s mind and\\n\\n(256)\\n\\x0c The Birth of the Asylum\\n\\nmanaged to induce her to leave her bed, to resume her\\ndomestic tasks, and even to spade her garden. . . . This\\nwas followed by the most fortunate effects, and by a cure\\nthat lasted three years.” Restored to the extreme simplicity\\nof this moral content, religion could not help conniving\\nwith philosophy and with medicine, with all the forms of\\nwisdom and science that can restore the reason in a disturbed mind. There are even instances of religion serving as\\na preliminary treatment, preparing for what will be done in\\nthe asylum: take the case of the young girl “of an ardent\\ntemperament, though very docile and pious” who was torn\\nbetween “the inclinations of her heart and the severe principles of her conduct”; her confessor, after having vainly\\ncounseled her to attach herself to God, proposed examples\\nof a firm and measured holiness, and “offered her the best\\nremedy against high passions: patience and time.” Taken to\\nLa Salpétriére, she was treated, on Pinel’s orders, “‘according to the same moral principles,” and her illness proved\\n“of very short duration.” Thus the asylum assimilates not\\nthe social theme of a religion in which men feel themselves\\nbrothers in the same communion and the same community,\\nbut the moral power of consolation, of confidence, and a\\ndocile fidelity to nature. It must resume the moral enterprise of religion, exclusive of its fantastic text, exclusively\\non the level of virtue, labor, and social life.\\n\\nThe asylum is a religious domain without religion, a\\ndomain of pure morality, of ethical uniformity, Everything\\nthat might retain the signs of the old differences was eliminated. The last vestiges of rite were extinguished. Formerly\\nthe house of confinement had inherited, in the social\\nsphere, the almost absolute limits of the lazar house; it was a\\nforeign country. Now the asylum must represent the great\\ncontinuity of social morality. The values of family and\\nwork, all the acknowledged virtues, now reign in the asylum. But their reign is a double one, First, they prevail in\\n\\n(257)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nfact, at the heart of madness itself; beneath the violence and\\ndisorder of insanity, the solid nature of the essential virtues\\nis not disrupted, There is a primitive morality which is\\nordinarily not affected even by the worst dementia; it is\\nthis morality which both appears and functions in the cure:\\n“I can generally testify to the pure virtues and severe principles often manifested by the cure. Nowhere except in\\nnovels have I seen spouses more worthy of being cherished,\\nparents more tender, lovers more passionate, or persons\\nmore attached to their duties than the majority of the insane fortunately brought to the period of convalescence.”**\\nThis inalienable virtue is both the truth and the resolution\\nof madness, Which is why, if it reigns, ic must reign as well.\\nThe asylum reduces differences, represses vice, eliminates\\nirregularities. It denounces everything that opposes the essential virtues of society: celibacy—“the number of girls\\nfallen into idiocy is seven times greater than the number of married women for the Year XI and the Year XIII;\\nfor dementia, the proportion is two to four times greater,\\nwe can thus deduce that marriage constirutes for women a\\nkind of preservative against the two sorts of insanity which\\nare most inveterate and most often incurable”; debauchery,\\nmisconduct, and “extreme perversity of habits”—“vicious\\nhabits such as drunkenness, limitless promiscuity, an apathetic lack of concern can gradually degrade the reason and\\nend in outright insanity”; laziness—“it is the most constant\\nand unanimous result of experience that in all public asyJums, as in prisons and hospitals, the surest and perhaps the\\nsole guarantee of the maintenance of health and good habits\\nand order is the law of rigorously executed mechanical\\nwork.” The asylum sets itself the task of the homogeneous\\nrule of morality, its rigorous extension to all those who\\ntend to escape from it.\\n\\nBut it thereby generates an indifference; if the law does\\n\\n(258)\\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\x0c The Birth of the Asylum\\n\\nnot reign universally, it is because there are men who do\\nnot recognize it, a class of society that lives in disorder, in\\nnegligence, and almost in illegality: “If on the one hand we\\nsee families prosper for a long series of years in the bosom\\nof harmony and order and concord, how many others, especially in the lower classes, afflict the cye with a repulsive\\nspectacle of debauchery, of dissensions, and shameful distress! That, according to my daily notes, is the most fertile\\nsource of the insanity we treat in the hospitals.”*\\n\\nIn one and the same movement, the asylum becomes, in\\nPinel’s hands, an instrument of moral uniformity and of\\nsocial denunciation. The problem is to impose, in a universal form, a morality that will prevail from within upon\\nthose who are strangers to it and in whom insanity is already present before it has made itself manifest. In the first\\ncase, the asylum must act as an awakening and a reminder,\\ninvoking a forgotten nature; in the second, it must act by\\nmeans of a social shift in order to snatch the individual\\nfrom his condition, The operation as practiced at the Retreat was still simple: religious segregation for purposes of\\nmoral purification. ‘The operation as practiced by Pinel was\\nrelatively complex: to effect moral syntheses, assuring an\\nethical continuity between the world of madness and the\\nworld of reason, but by practicing a social segregation that\\nwould guarantee bourgeois morality a universality of fact\\nand permit it to be imposed as a law upon all forms of\\ninsanity.\\n\\nIn the classical period, indigence, laziness, vice, and madness mingled in an equal guilt within unreason, madmen\\nwere caught in the great confinement of poverty and unemployment, but all had been promoted, in the proximity\\nof transgression, to the essence of a Fall. Now madness\\nbelonged to social failure, which appeared without distinction as its cause, model, and limit. Half a century later,\\n\\n(259)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMaoness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nmental disease would become degeneracy. Henceforth, the\\nessential madness, and the really dangerous one, was that\\nwhich rose from the lower depths of society.\\n\\nPinel’s asylum would never be, as a retreat from the\\nworld, a space of nature and immediate truth like Tuke’s,\\n’ but a uniform domain of legislation, a site of moral syntheses where insanities born on the outer limits of society\\nwere eliminated, The entire life of the inmates, the entire\\nconduct of their keepers and doctors, were organized by\\nPinel so that these moral syntheses would function. And\\nthis by three principal means:\\n\\n1. Silence. The fifth chained prisoner released by Pinel\\nwas a former ecclesiastic whose madness had caused hin to\\nbe excommunicated; suffering from delusions of grandeur,\\nhe believed he was Christ; this was “the height of human\\narrogance in delirium.” Sent to Bicétre in 1782, he had been\\nin chains for twelve years. For the pride of his bearing, the\\ngrandiloquence of his ideas, he was one of the most celebrated spectacles of the entire hospital, but as he knew that\\nhe was reliving Christ’s Passion, “he endured with patience\\nthis long martyrdom and the continual sarcasms his mania\\nexposed him to.” Pinel chose him as one of the first twelve\\nto be released, though his delirium was still acute. But Pinel\\ndid not treat him as he did the others; without a word, he\\nhad his chains struck off, and “ordered expressly that\\neveryone imitate his own reserve and not address a word to\\nthis poor madman. This prohibition, which was rigorously\\nobserved, produced upon this self-intoxicated creature an\\neffect much more perceptible than irons and the dungeon;\\nhe felt humiliated in an abandon and an isolation so new to him amid his freedom. Finally, after long hesications, they\\nsaw him come of his own accord to join the society of the\\nother patients; henceforth, he returned to more sensible\\nand true ideas.””\\n\\nDeliverance here has a paradoxical meaning. The dun\\n(260)\\n\\x0c  \\n\\nThe Birth of the Asylum\\n\\ngeon, the chains, the continual spectacle, the sarcasms were,\\nto the sufferer in his delirium, the very element of his liberty. Acknowledged in that very fact and fascinated from\\nwithout by so much complicity, he could not be dislodged\\nfrom his immediate truth. But the chains rhat fell, the indifference and silence of all those around him confined\\nhim in the limited use of an empty liberty; he was delivered\\nin silence to a truth which was not acknowledged. and\\nwhich he would demonstrate in vain, since he was no\\nlonger a spectacle, and from which he could derive no exaltation, since he was not even humiliated. It was the man\\nhimself, not his projection in a delirium, who was now\\nhumiliated: for physical constraint yielded to a liberty that\\nconstantly touched the limits of solitude; the dialogue of\\ndelirium and insult gave way to a monologue in a language\\nwhich exhausted itself in the silence of others; the entire\\nshow of presumption and outrage was replaced by indifference. Henceforth, more genuinely confined than he\\ncould have been in a dungeon and chains, a prisoner of\\nnothing but himself, the sufferer was caught in a relation to\\nhimself that was of the order of transgression, and in a nonrelation to others that was of the order of shame, The others are made innocent, they are no longer persecutors, the\\nguilt is shifted inside, showing the madman that he was\\nfascinated by nothing but his own presumption; the enemy\\nfaces disappear; he no longer feels theit presence as observation, but as a denial of attention, as observation deflected; the others are now nothing but a limit that ceaselessly recedes as he advances. Delivered from his chains, he\\nis now chained, by silence, to transgression and to shame.\\nHe feels himself punished, and he sees the sign of his innocence in that fact; free from all physical punishment, he\\nmust prove himself guilty. His torment was his glory; his\\ndeliverance must humiliate him.\\n\\nCompared to the incessant dialogue of reason and mad\\n(2617)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nness during the Renaissance, classical internment had been a\\nsilencing. But it was not total: language was engaged in\\nthings rather than really suppressed. Confinement, prisons,\\ndungeons, even tortures, engaged in a mute dialogue between reason and unreason—the dialogue of struggle. This\\ndialogue itself was now disengaged; silence was absolute;\\nthere was no longer any common language between madness and reason; the language of delirium can be answered\\nonly by an absence of language, for delirium is not a fragment of dialogue with reason, it is not language at all; it\\nrefers, in an ultimately silent awareness, only to transgression. And it is only at this point that a common language\\nbecomes possible again, insofar as it will be one of acknowledged guilt, “Finally, after long hesitations, they saw him\\ncome of his own accord to join the society of the other\\npatients . . .” The absence of Janguage, as a fundamental\\nstructure of asylum life, has its correlative in the exposure\\nof confession. When Freud, in psychoanalysis, cautiously\\nreinstitutes exchange, or rather begins once again to listen\\nto this language, henceforth eroded into monologue, should\\nwe be astonished that the formulations he hears are always\\nthose of transgression? In this inveterate silence, transgression has taken over the very sources of speech,\\n\\n2. Recognition by Mirror, At the Retreat, the madman\\nwas observed, and knew he was observed; but except for\\nthat direct observation which permitted only an indirect\\napprehension of itself, madness had no immediate grasp of\\nits own character. With Pinel, on the contrary, observation\\noperated only within the space defined by madness, without surface or exterior limits. Madness would see itself,\\nwould be seen by itself—-pure spectacle and absolute subject.\\n\\n“Three insane persons, each of whom believed himself to\\nbe a king, and each of whom took the title Louis XVI,\\nquarreled one day over the prerogatives of royalty, and\\ndefended them somewhat too energetically. The keeper ap\\n(262)\\n\\x0c The Birth of the Asylum\\n\\nproached one of them, and drawing him aside, asked:\\n‘Why do you argue with these men who are evidently\\nmad? Doesn’t everyone know that you should be recognized as Louis XVI?’ Flattered by this homage, the madman immediately withdrew, glancing at the others with a\\ndisdainful hauteur. The same trick worked with the second\\npatient. And thus in an instant there no longer remained\\nany trace of an argument.” This is the first phase, that of\\nexaltation. Madness is made to observe itself, but in others:\\nit appears in them as a baseless pretense—in other words, as\\nabsurd. However, in this observation that condemns others,\\nthe madman assures his own justification and the certainty\\nof being adequate to his delirium. The rift between presumption and reality allows itself to be recognized only in\\nthe object. It is entirely masked, on the contrary, in the\\nsubject, which becomes immediate truth and absolute\\njudge: the exalted sovereignty that denounces the others’\\nfalse sovereignty dispossesses them and thus confirms itself\\nin the unfailing plenitude of presumption. Madness, as\\nsimple delirium, is projected onto others; as perfect unconsciousness, it is entirely accepted.\\n\\nIt is at this point that the mirror, as an accomplice, becomes an agent of demystification. Another inmate of Bicétre, also believing himself a king, always expressed himself “in a tone of command and with supreme authority.”\\nOne day when he was calmer, the keeper approached him\\nand asked why, if he were a sovereign, he did not put an\\nend to his detention, and why he remained mingled with\\nmadmen of all kinds. Resuming this speech the following\\ndays, “he made him see, little by little, the absurdity of his\\npretensions, showed him another madman who had also\\nbeen long convinced that he possessed supreme power and\\nhad become an object of mockery. At first the maniac felt\\nshaken, soon he cast doubts upon his title of sovereign, and\\nfinally he came to realize his chimerical vagaries. It was in\\n\\n(263)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n   \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\ntwo weeks that this unexpected moral revolution took\\nplace, and after several months of tests, this worthy father\\n‘was restored to his family.”\\'* This, then, is the phase of\\nabasement: presumptuously identified with the object of\\nhis delirium, the madman recognizes himself as in a mirror\\nin this madness whose absurd pretensions he has denounced; his solid sovereignty as a subject dissolves in this\\nobject he has demystified by accepting it. He is now pitilessly observed by himself. And in the silence of those who\\nrepresent reason, and who have done nothing but hold up\\nthe perilous mirror, he recognizes himself as objectively\\nmad. ‘\\nWe have seen by what means—and by what mystifications—eighteenth-century therapeutics tried to persuade\\nthe madman of his madness in order to release him from it.\\nHere the movement is of an entirely different nature; it is\\nnot 2 question of dissipating error by the impressive spectacle of a truth, even a pretended truth; but of treating\\nmadness in its arrogance rather than in its aberration. The\\nclassical mind condemned in madness 2 certain blindness to\\nthe truth; from Pinel on, madness would be regarded rather\\nas an impulse from the depths which exceeds the juridical\\nlimits of the individual, ignores the moral limits fixed for\\nhim, and tends to an apotheosis of the self. For the nineteenth century, the initial model of madness would be to\\nbelieve oneself to be God, while for the preceding centuries\\nit had been to deny God. Thus madness, in the spectacle of\\nitself as unreason humiliated, was able to find its salvation\\nwhen, imprisoned in the absolute subjectivity of its delirium, it surprised the absurd and objective image of that\\ndelirium in the identical madman. Truth insinuated itself, as\\nif by surprise (and not by violence, in the eighteenth-century mode), in this play of reciprocal observations where it\\nnever saw anything\\'but itself. But the asylum, in this community of madmen, placed the mirrors in such a way that\\n\\n(264)\\n\\n  \\n\\x0c “Stultifera Navis”\\n\\nthe melancholy of the English was easily explained by the\\ninfluence of a maritime climate, cold, humidity, the instability of the weather; all those fine droplets of water chat\\npenetrated the channels and fibers of the human body and\\nmade ic lose its firmness, predisposed it to madness. Finally,\\nneglecting an immense literature that stretches from Ophelia to the Lorelei, let us note only the great half-anthropological, half-cosmological analyses of Heinroth, which interpret madness as the manifestation in man of an obscure\\nand aquatic element, a dark disorder, a moving chaos, the\\nseed and death of all things, which opposes the mind’s luminous and adult stability.\\n\\nBut if the navigation of madmen is linked in the Western\\nmind with so many immemorial motifs, why, so abruptly,\\nin the fifteenth century, is the theme suddenly formulated\\nin literature and iconography? Why does the figure of the\\nShip of Fools and its insane crew all at once invade the\\nmost familiar landscapes? Why, from the old union of\\nwarer and madness, was this ship born one day, and on just\\nthat day?\\n\\nBecause it symbolized a great disquiet, suddenly dawning\\non the horizon of European culture at the end of the\\nMiddle Ages, Madness and the madman become major\\nfigures, in their ambiguity: menace and mockery, the dizzying unreason of the world, and the feeble ridicule of men.\\n\\nFirst a whole literature of tales and moral fables, in\\norigin, doubtless, quite remote. But by the end of the\\nMiddle Ages, it bulks large: a long series of “follies” which,\\nstigmatizing vices and faults as in the past, no longer attribute them all to pride, to lack of charity, to neglect of\\nChristian virtues, but to a sort of great unreason for which\\nnothing, in fact, is exactly responsible, buc which involves\\neveryone in a kind of secret complicity, The denunciation\\nof madness (/a folie) becomes the general form of criticism.\\n\\n(73)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nThe Birth of the Asylum\\n\\nthe madman, when all was said and done, inevitably surprised himself, despite himself, as @ madman. Freed from\\nthe chains that made it a purely observed object, madness\\nlost, paradoxically, the essence of its liberty, which was\\nsolitary exaltation; it became responsible for what it knew\\nof its truth; it imprisoned itself in an infinitely self-referring\\nobservation; it was finally chained to the humiliation of\\nbeing its own object. Awareness was now linked to the\\nshame of being identical to that other, of being compromised in him, and of already despising oneself before being\\nable to recognize or to know oneself.\\n\\n3. Perpetual Judgment. By this play of mirrors, as by silence, madness is ceaselessly called upon to judge itself. But\\nbeyond this, it is at every moment judged from without;\\njudged not by moral or scientific conscience, but by a sort\\nof invisible tribunal in permanent session. ‘The asylum Pinel\\ndreamed of and partly realized at Bicétre, but especially at\\nLa Salpétriére, is a juridical microcosm. To be efficacious,\\nthis judgment must be redoubtable in aspect; all the iconogtaphic apanage of the judge and the executioner must be\\npresent in the mind of the madman, so that he understands\\nwhat universe of judgment he now belongs to. The decor\\nof justice, in all its terror and implacability, will thus be\\npart of the treatment. One of the inmates at Bicétre\\nsuffered from a religious delirium animated by a fear of\\nhell; he believed that the only way he could escape eternal\\ndamnation was by rigorous abstinence. It was necessary to\\ncompensate this fear of a remote justice by the presence of\\n2 more immediate and still more redoubtable one: “Could\\nthe irresistible curse of his sinister ideas be counterbalanced\\nother than by the impression of a strong and deep fear?”\\nOne evening, the director came to the patient\\'s door “with\\nmatter likely to produce fear--an angry eye, a thundering\\ntone of voice, a group of the staff armed with strong\\nchains that they shook noisily. They set some soup beside\\n\\n(265)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMADNESS & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nthe madman and gave him precise orders to eat it during\\nthe night, or else suffer the most cruel treatment. They\\nretired, and left the madman in the most distressed state of\\nindecision between the punishment with which he was\\nthreatened and the frightening prospect of the torments in\\nthe life to come. After an inner combat of several hours,\\nthe former idea prevailed, and he decided to take some\\nnourishment,”\\n\\nThe asylum as a juridical instance recognized no other. It\\njudged immediately, and without appeal. It possessed its own\\ninstruments of punishment, and used them as it saw fit. The\\nold confinement had generally been practiced outside of\\nnormal juridical forms, but it imitated the punishment of\\ncriminals, using the same prisons, the same dungeons, the\\nsame physical brutality. The justice that reigned in Pinel’s\\nasylum did not borrow its modes of repression from the\\nother justice, but invented its own. Or rather, it used the\\ntherapeutic methods that had become known in the eighteenth century, but used them as chastisements. And this is\\nnot the least of the paradoxes of Pinel’s “philanthropic”\\nand “liberating” enterprise, this conversion of medicine\\ninto justice, of therapeutics into repression. In the medicine\\nof the classical period, baths and showers were used as remedies as a result of the physicians’ vagaries about the nature\\nof the nervous system: the intention was to refresh the\\norganism, to relax the desiccated fibers; it is true that they\\nalso added, among the happy consequences of the cold\\nshower, the psychological effect of the unpleasant surprise\\nwhich interrupted the course of ideas and changed the nature of sentiments; but we were still in the landscape of\\nmedical speculation, With Pinel, the use of the shower became frankly juridical; the shower was the habitual punishment of the ordinary police tribunal that sat permanently at the asylum: “Considered as a means of repression,\\nit often suffices to subject to the general law of manual\\n\\n(266)\\n\\x0c The Birth of the Asylum\\n\\nlabor a madman who is susceptible to it, in order to conquer an obstinate refusal to take nourishment, and to subjugate insane persons carried away by a sort of turbulent\\nand reasoned humor.”\\n\\nEverything was organized so that the madman would\\nrecognize himself in a world of judgment that enveloped\\nhim on all sides; he must know that he is watched, judged,\\nand condemned; from transgression to punishment, the\\nconnection must be evident, as a guilt recognized by all:\\n“We profit from the circumstance of the bath, remind him\\nof the transgression, or of the omission of an important\\nduty, and with the aid of a faucet suddenly release a\\nshower of, cold water upen his head, which often disconcerts the madman or drives out a predominant idea by a\\nstrong and unexpected impression; if the idea persists, the\\nshower is repeated, but care is taken to avoid the hard tone\\nand the shocking terms that would cause rebellion; on the\\ncontrary, the madman is made to understand that it is for\\nhis sake and reluctantly that we resort to such violent\\nmeasures; sometimes we add a joke, taking care not to go\\ntoo far with it.”1° This almost arithmetical obviousness of\\npunishment, repeated as often as necessary, the recognition\\nof transgression by its repression—all this must end in the\\ninternalization of the juridical instance, and the birth of\\nremorse in the inmate’s mind: it is only at this point that the\\njudges agree to stop the punishment, certain that it will\\ncontinue indefinitely in the inmate’s conscience. One maniac had the habit of tearing her clothes and breaking any\\nobject that came into her hands; she was given showers, she\\nwas put into a straitjacket, she finally appeared “humiliated\\nand dismayed”; but fearing that this shame might be transitory and this remorse too superficial, “‘the director, in order\\nto impress a feeling of terror upon her, spoke to her with\\nthe most energetic firmness, but without anger, and announced to her that she would henceforth be treated with\\n\\n(267)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMaAvNESS & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nthe greatest severity.” The desired result was not long in\\ncoming: “Her repentance was announced by a torrent of\\ntears which she shed for almost two hours.” The cycle is\\ncomplete twice over: the transgression is punished and its\\nauthor recognizes her guilt.\\n\\nThere were, however, madmen who escaped from this\\nmovement and resisted the moral synthesis it brought about.\\nThese latter would be set apart in the heart of the asylum,\\nforming a new confined population, which could not even\\nrelate to justice. When we speak of Pinel and his work of\\nliberation, we too often omit this second reclusion. We\\nhave already seen that he denied the benefits of asylum\\nreform to “fanatics who believe themselves inspired and\\nseek to make converts, and who take a perfidious pleasure\\nin inciting the other madmen to disobedience on the pretext\\nthat it is better to obey God than man.” But confinement\\nand the dungeon will be equally obligatory for “those who\\ncannot be subjected to the general law of work and who, in\\nmalicious activity, enjoy tormenting the other inmates,\\nprovoking and ceaselessly inciting them to subjects of discord,” and for women “who during their seizures have an\\nirresistible propensity to steal anything they can lay cheir\\nhands on.” Disobedience by religious fanaticism, resistance\\nto work, and theft, the three great transgressions against\\nbourgeois society, the three major offenses against its essential values, are not excusable, even by madness; they deserve imprisonment pure and simple, exclusion in the most\\nrigorous sense of the term, since they all manifest the same\\nresistance to the moral and social uniformity that forms the\\nraison d’étre of Pinel’s asylum.\\n\\nFormerly, unreason was set outside of judgment, to be\\ndelivered, arbitrarily, to the powers of reason, Now it is\\njudged, and not only upon entering the asylum, in order to\\nbe recognized, classified, and made innocent forever; it is\\ncaught, on the contrary, in a perpetual judgment, which\\n\\n(268)\\n\\x0c The Birth of the Asylum\\n\\nnever ceases to pursue it and to apply sanctions, to proclaim\\nits transgressions, to require honorable amends, to exclude,\\nfinally, those whose transgressions risk compromising the\\nsocial order, Madness escaped from the arbitrary only in\\norder to enter a kind of endless trial for which the asylum\\nfurnished simultaneously police, magistrates, and torturers;\\natrial whereby any transgression in life, by a virtue proper\\nto life in the asylum, becomes a social crime, observed,\\ncondemned, and punished; a trial which has no outcome\\nbut in a perpetual recommencement in the internalized\\nform of remorse. The madmen “delivered” by Pinel and,\\nafter him, the madmen of modern confinement are under\\narraignment; if they have the privilege of no longer being\\nassociated or identified with convicts, they are condemned,\\nat every moment, to be subject to an accusation whose text\\nis never given, for it is their entire life in the asylum which\\nconstitutes it. The asylum of the age of positivism, which it\\nis Pinel’s glory to have founded, is not a free realm of observation, diagnosis, and therapeutics; it is a juridical space\\nwhere one is accused, judged, and condemned, and from\\nwhich one is never released except by the version of this\\ntrial in psychological depth—that is, by remorse. Madness\\nwill be punished in the asylum, even if it is innocent outside\\nof it. For a long time to come, and until our own day at\\nleast, it is imprisoned in a moral world.\\n\\nTo silence, to recognition in the mirror, to perpetual\\njudgment, we must add a fourth structure peculiar to the\\nworld of the asylum as it was constituted at the end of the\\neighteenth century: this is the apotheosis of the medical\\npersonage. Of them all, it is doubtless the most important,\\nsince it would authorize not only new contacts between\\ndoctor and patient, but a new relation between insanity and\\nmedical thought, and ultimately command the whole modern experience of madness. Hitherto, we find in the asy\\n(269)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nManpness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nlums only the same structures of confinement, but displaced and deformed. With the new status of the medical\\npersonage, the deepest meaning of confinement is abolished: mental disease, with the meanings we now give it, is\\nmade possible.\\n\\nThe work of Tuke and of Pinel, whose spirit and values\\nare so different, meet in this transformation of the medical\\npersonage. The physician, as we have seen, played no part\\nin the life of confinement. Now he becomes the essential\\nfigure of the asylum. He is in charge of entry. The ruling\\nat the Retreat is precise: “On the admission of patients, the\\ncommittee should, in general, require a certificate signed by\\na medical person, . . . It should also be stated whether the\\npatient is afflicted with any complaint independent of insanity. It is also desirable that some account should be sent,\\nhow long the patient has been disordered; whether any, or\\nwhat sort of medical means have been used.”!7 From the\\nend of the eighteenth century, the medical certificate becomes almost obligatory for the confinement of madmen.\\nBur within the asylum itself, the doctor takes a preponderant place, insofar as he converts it into a medical space.\\nHowever, and this is the essential point, the doctor\\'s intervention is not made by virtue of a medical skill or power\\nthat he possesses in himself and that would be justified by a\\nbody of objective knowledge. Ir is not as a scientist that\\nhomo medicus has authority in the asylum, but as a wise\\nman. If the medical profession is required, it is as a juridical\\nand moral guarantee, not in the name of science. A man of\\ngreat probity, of utter virtue and scruple, who had had long\\nexperience in the asylum would do as well. For the medical\\nenterprise is only a part of an enormous moral task that\\nmust be accomplished at the asylum, and which alone can\\nensure the cure of the insane: “Must it not be an inviolable\\nlaw in the administration of any establishment for the insane, whether public or private, to grant the maniac all the\\n\\n(270)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nThe Birth of the Asylum\\n\\nliberty that the safety of his person and of that of others\\npermits, and to proportion his repression to the greater or\\nlesser seriousness of danger of his deviations ..., to\\ngather all the facts that can serve to enlighten the physician\\nin treatment, to study with care the particular varieties of\\nbehavior and temperament, and accordingly to use gentleness or firmness, conciliatory terms or the tone of authority\\nand an inflexible severity?’\"* According to Samuel Tuke,\\nthe first doctor appointed at the Retreat was recommended\\nby his “indefatigable perseverance”; doubtless he had no\\nparticular knowledge of mental illnesses when he entered\\nthe asylum, but “he entered on his office with the anxiety\\nand ardor of a feeling mind, upon the exertion of whose\\nskill, depended the dearest interest of many of his fellowcreatures.” He tried the various remedies that his own common sense and the experience of his predecessors suggested.\\nBut he was soon disappointed, not because the results were\\nbad, or that the number of cures was minimal: “Yet the\\nmedical means were so imperfectly connected with the\\nprogress of recovery, that he could not avoid suspecting them, to be rather concomitants than causes.” He\\nthen realized that there was little to be done using the medical methods known up to that time. The concern for humanity prevailed within him, and he decided to use no\\nmedicament that would be too disagreeable to the patient.\\nBut it must not be thought that the doctor’s role had little\\nimportance at the Retreat: by the visits he paid regularly to\\nthe patients, by the authority he exercised in the house over\\nall the staff, “the physician . . . sometimes possesses more\\ninfluence over the patients’ minds, than the other attendants,”\\n\\nIt is thought that Tuke and Pinel opened the asylum to\\nmedical knowledge. They did not introduce science, but a\\npersonality, whose powers borrowed from science only\\ntheir disguise, or at most their justification. These powers,\\n\\n(2714)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nby their nature, were of a moral and social order; they took\\nroot in the madman’s minority status, in the insanity of his\\nperson, not of his mind. If the medical personage could\\nisolate madness, it was not because lie knew it, but because\\nhe mastered it; and what for positivism would be an image of\\nobjectivity was only the other side of this domination. “It is a\\nvery important object to win the confidence of these sufferers, and to arouse in them feelings of respect and obedience,\\nwhich can only be the fruit of superior discernment, distinguished education, and dignity of tone and manner. Stupidity, ignorance, and the lack of principles, sustained by a\\ntyrannical harshness, may incite fear, but always inspire distrust. The keeper of madmen who has obtained domination\\nover them directs and rules their conduct as he pleases; he\\nmust be endowed with a firm character, and on occasion\\ndisplay an imposing strength. He must threaten little but\\ncarry out his threats, and if he is disobeyed, punishment\\nmust immediately ensue.”*® The physician could exercise\\nhis absolute authority in the world of the asylum only insofar as, from the beginning, he was Father and Judge,\\nFamily and Law—his medical practice being for a long time\\nno more than a complement to the old rites of Order,\\nAuthority, and Punishment. And Pinel was well aware that\\nthe doctor cures when, exclusive of modern therapeutics,\\nhe brings into play these immemorial figures.\\n\\nPinel cites the case of a girl of seventeen who had been\\nraised by her parents with “extreme indulgence”; she had\\nfallen into a “giddy, mad delirium without any cause that\\ncould be determined”, at the hospital she was treated with\\ngreat gentleness, but she always showed a certain “haughuness” which could not be tolerated at the asylum; she spoke\\n“of her parents with nothing but bitterness.” It was decided\\nto subject her to a regime of strict authority; “the keeper,\\nin order to tame this inflexible character, seized the moment\\nof the bath and expressed himself forcibly concerning cer\\n(272)\\n\\x0c  \\n\\nThe Birth of the Asylum\\n\\ntain unnatural persons who dared oppose their parents and\\ndisdain their authority. He warned the girl she would\\nhenceforth be treated with all the severity she deserved, for\\nshe herself was opposed to her cure and dissimulated with\\ninsurmountable obstinacy the basic cause of her illness.”\\nThrough this new rigor and these threats, the sick girl felc\\n“profoundly moved . . . she ended by acknowledging her\\nwrongs and making a frank confession that she had\\nsuffered a loss of reason as the result of a forbidden romantic attachment, naming the person who had been its object.” After this first confession, the cure became easy: “a\\nmost favorable alteration occurred .. . she was hence-~\\nforth soothed and could not sufficiently express her gratitude toward the keeper who had brought an end to her\\ncontinual agitation, and had restored tranquillity and calm\\nto her heart.” There is not a moment of the story that\\ncould not be transcribed in psychoanalytical terms. To such\\na degree was it true that the medical personage, according\\nto Pinel, had to act not as the result of an objective definition of the disease or a specific classifying diagnosis, but by\\nrelying upon that prestige which envelops the secrets of the\\nFamily, of Authority, of Punishment, and of Love; it is by\\nbringing such powers into play, by wearing the mask of\\nFather and of Judge, that the physician, by one of those\\nabrupt short cuts that leave aside mere medical competence,\\nbecame the -almost magic perpetrator of the cure, and assumed the aspect of a Thaumaturge; it was enough that he\\nobserved and spoke, to cause secret faults to appear, insane\\npresumptions to vanish, and madness at last to yield to\\nreason. His presence and his words were gifted with that\\npower of disalienation, which at one blow revealed the\\ntransgression and restored the order of morality.\\n\\nIt is a curious paradox to see medical practice enter the\\nuncertain domain of the quasi-miraculous at the very moment when the knowledge of mental illness tries to assume\\n\\n(273)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\na positive meaning. On the one hand, madness puts itself at\\na distance in an objective field where the threats of unreason\\ndisappear; but at this same moment, the madman tends to\\nform with the doctor, in an unbroken unity, 2 “couple”\\nwhose complicity dates back to very old links. Life in the\\nasylum as Tuke and Pinel constituted it permitted the birth\\nof that delicate structure which would become the essential\\nnucleus of madness—a structure that formed a kind of\\nmicrocosm in which were symbolized the massive structures of bourgeois society and its values: Family-Child relations, centered on the theme of paternal authority; Transgression-Punishment relations, centered on the theme of\\nimmediate justice; Madness-Disorder relations, centered on\\nthe theme of social and moral order. It is from these that the\\nphysician derives his power to cure; and it is to the degree\\nthat the patient finds himself, by so many old links, already\\nalienated in the doctor, within the doctor-patient couple,\\nthat the doctor has the almost miraculous power to cure\\nhim.\\n\\nIn the time of Pinel and Tuke, this power had nothing\\nextraordinary about it, it was explained and demonstrated\\nin the efficacity, simply, of moral behavior; it was no more\\nmysterious than the power of the eighteenth-century doctor when he diluted fluids or relaxed fibers. But very soon\\nthe meaning of this moral practice escaped the physician, to\\nthe very extent that he enclosed his knowledge in the\\nnorms of positivism: from the beginning of the nineteenth\\ncentury, the psychiatrist no longer quite knew what was\\nthe nature of the power he had inherited from the great\\nreformers, and whose efficacity seemed so foreign to his\\nidea of mental illness and to the practice of all other doctors,\\n\\nThis psychiatric practice, mysterious even to those who\\nused it, is very important in the situation of the madman\\nwithin the medical world. First because medicine of the\\n\\n(274)\\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavwness & CivILIZATION\\n\\nIn farces and soties, the character of the Madman, the Fool,\\nor the Simpleton assumes more and more importance. He is\\nno longer simply a ridiculous and familiar silhouette in the\\nwings: he stands center stage as the guardian of truth—\\nplaying here a role which is the complement and converse\\nof that taken by madness in the tales and the satires. If folly\\nJeads each man into a blindness where he is lost, the madman, on the contrary, reminds each man of his truth; in a\\ncomedy where each man deceives the other and dupes himself, the madman is comedy to the second degree: the deception of deception; he utters, in his simpleton’s language\\nwhich makes no show of reason, the words of reason that\\nrelease, in the comic, the comedy: he speaks love to lovers,\\nthe truth of life to the young, the middling reality of things\\nto the proud, to the insolent, and to liars, Even the old\\nfeasts of fools, so popular in Flanders and northern Europe,\\nwere theatrical events, and organized into social and moral\\ncriticism, whatever they may have contained of spontaneous religious parody.\\n\\nIn learned literature, too, Madness or Folly was at work,\\nat the very heart of reason and truth. It is Folly which\\nembarks all men without distinction on its insane ship and\\nbinds them to the vocation of a common odyssey (Van\\nOestvoren’s Blauwe Schute, Brant’s Narrenschiff); ic is\\nFolly whose baleful reign Thomas Murner conjures up in\\nhis Narrenbeschwérung; it is Folly which gets the best of\\nLove in Corroz’s satire Contre fol amour, or argues with\\nLove as to which of the two comes first, which of the two\\nmakes the other possible, and triumphs in Louise Labé’s\\ndialogue, Débat de folie et d’amour. Folly also has its academic pastimes; it is the object of argument, ic contends\\nagainst itself; it is denounced, and defends itself by claiming\\nthat it is closer to happiness and truth than reason, chat it is\\ncloser to reason than reason itself; Jakob Wimpfeling edits\\nthe Monopolium philosopborum, and Judocus Gallus the\\n\\n(14)\\n\\x0c The Birth of the Asylum\\n\\nmind for the first time in the history of Western science\\nwas to assume almost complete autonomy: from the time of\\nthe Greeks, it had been no more than a chapter of medicine, and we have seen Willis study madness under the\\nrubric “diseases of the head”; after Pinel and Tuke, psychiatry would become a medicine of a particular style: those\\nmost eager to discover the origin of madness in organic\\ncauses or in hereditary dispositions would not be able to\\navoid this style. They would be all the more unable to\\navoid it in that this particular style—bringing into play\\nincreasingly obscure moral powers—would originally be a\\nsort of bad conscience; they would increasingly confine\\nthemselves in positivism, the more they felt their practice\\nslipping out of it.\\n\\nAs positivism imposes itself upon medicine and psychiatry, this practice becomes more and more obscure, the\\npsychiatrist’s power more and more miraculous, and the\\ndoctor-patient couple sinks deeper into a strange world. In\\nthe patient’s eyes, the doctor becomes a thaumaturge; the\\nauthority he has borrowed from order, morality, and the\\nfamily now seems to derive from himself; it is because he is\\na doctor that he is believed to possess these powers, and\\nwhile Pinel, with Tuke, strongly asserted that his moral\\naction was not necessarily linked to any scientific competence, it was thought, and by the patience first of all, that it\\nwas in the esotericism of his knowledge, in some almost\\ndaemonic secret of knowledge, that the doctor had found\\nthe power to unravel insanity; and increasingly the patient\\nwould accept this self-surrender to a doctor both divine\\nand satanic, beyond human measure in any case; increasingly he would alienate himself in the physician, accepting\\nentirely and in advance all his prestige, submitting from\\nthe very first to a will he experienced as magic, and to a\\nscience he regarded as prescience.and divination, thus becoming the ideal and perfect correlative of those powers he\\n\\n(275)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavNESS & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nprojected upon the doctor, pure object without any resistance except his own inertia, quite ready to become precisely\\nthat hysteric in whom Charcot exalted the doctor’s marvelous powers. If we wanted to analyze the profound structures\\nof objectivity in the knowledge and practice of nineteenthcentury psychiatry from Pinel to Freud,” we should have\\nto show in fact that such objectivity was from the start a\\nreification of a magical nature, which could only be accomplished with the complicity of the patient himself, and\\nbeginning from a transparent and clear moral practice,\\ngradually forgotten as positivism imposed its myths of scientific objectivity; a practice forgotten in its origins and its\\nmeaning, but always used and always present. What we\\ncall psychiatric practice is a certain moral tactic contemporary with the end of the eighteenth century, preserved in\\nthe rites of asylum life, and overlaid by the myths of positivism.\\n\\nBut if the doctor soon became a thaumaturge for the\\npatient, he could not be one in his own positivist doctor\\'s\\neyes. That obscure power whose origin he no longer knew,\\nin which he could not decipher che patient’s complicity,\\nand in which he would not consent to acknowledge the\\nancient powers which constituted it, nevertheless had to be\\ngiven some status; and since nothing in positivist understanding could justify such a transfer of will or similar remote-control operations, the moment would soon come\\nwhen madness itself would be held responsible for such\\nanomalies. These cures without basis, which must be recognized as not being false cures, would soon become the\\ntrue cures of false illnesses. Madness was not what one believed, nor what it believed itself to be; it was infinitely less\\nthan itself: a combination of persuasion and mystification.\\nWe can see here the genesis of Babinski’s pithiatism. And\\nby a strange reversal, thought leaped back almost two centuries to the era when between madness, false madness, and\\n\\n(276)\\n\\x0c The Birth of the Asylum\\n\\nthe simulation of madness, the limit was indistinct—identical symptoms confused to the point where transgression\\nreplaced unity; further still, medical thought finally\\neffected an identification over which all Western thought\\nsince Greek medicine had hesitated: the identification of\\nmadness with madness—that is, of the medical concept\\nwith the critical concept of madness. At the end of the\\nnineteenth century, and in the thought of Babinski’s contemporaries, we find that prodigious postulate, which no\\nmedicine had yet dared formulate: that madness, after all,\\nwas only madness,\\n\\nThus while the victim of mental illness is entirely alienated in the real person of his doctor, the doctor dissipates\\nthe reality of the mental illness in the critical concept of\\nmadness. So that there remains, beyond the empty forms of\\npositivist thought, only a single concrete reality: the doctorpatient couple in which all alienations are summarized,\\nlinked, and loosened. And it is to this degree that all nineteenth-century psychiatry really converges on Freud, the\\nfirst man to accept in all its seriousness the reality of the\\nphysician-patient couple, the first to consent not to look\\naway nor to investigate elsewhere, the first not to attempt\\nto hide it in a psychiatric theory that more or less harmonized with the rest of medical knowledge; the first to follow\\nits consequences with absolute rigor. Freud demystified alk\\nthe other asylum structures: he abolished silence and observation, he eliminated madness’s recognition of itself in\\nthe mirror of its own spectacle, he silenced the instances of\\ncondemnation. But on the other hand he exploited the\\nstructure that enveloped the medical personage; he amplified its thaumaturgical virtues, preparing for its omnipotence a quasi-divine status. He focussed upon this single\\npresence-~-concealed behind the patient and above him, in\\nan absence that is also a total presence—all the powers that\\nhad been distributed in the collective existence of the asy\\n(277)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nManvness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nlum; he transformed this into an absolute Observation, a\\npure and circumspect Silence, a Judge who punishes and\\nrewards in a judgment that does not even condescend to\\nlanguage; he made it the Mirror in which madness, in an\\nalmost motionless movement, clings to and casts off itself.\\n\\nTo the doctor, Freud transferred all the structures Pinel\\nand Tuke had set up within confinement. He did deliver\\nthe patient from the existence of the asylum within which\\nhis “liberators” had alienated him; but he did not deliver\\nhim from what was essential in this existence; he regrouped\\nits powers, extended them to the maximum by uniting them\\nin the doctor’s hands; he created the psychoanalytical situation where, by an inspired short-circuit, alienation becomes\\ndisalienating because, in the doctor, it becomes a subject.\\n\\nThe doctor, as an alienating figure, remains the key to\\npsychoanalysis. It is perhaps because it did not suppress this\\nultimate structure, and because it referred all the others to\\nit, that psychoanalysis has not been able, will not be able, to\\nhear the voices of unreason, nor to decipher in themselves\\nthe signs of the madman. Psychoanalysis can unravel some\\nof the forms of madness; it remains a stranger to the sovereign enterprise of unreason. It can neither liberate nor\\ntranscribe, nor most certainly explain, what is essential in\\nthis enterprise.\\n\\nSince the end of the eighteenth century, the life of unreason no longer manifests itself except in the lightningflash of works such as those of Hélderlin, of Nerval, of\\nNietzsche, or of Artaud—forever irreducible to those\\nalienations that can be cured, resisting by their own\\nstrength that gigantic moral imprisonment which we are in,\\nthe habit of calling, doubtless by antiphrasis, the liberation\\nof the insane by Pinel and Tuke.\\n\\n(278)\\n\\x0c ae\\n\\nx»\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nTue Goya who painted The Madhouse must have experienced before that grovel of flesh in the void, that nakedness\\namong bare walls, something related to a contemporary\\npathos: the symbolic tinsel that crowned the insane kings\\nleft in full view suppliane bodies, bodies vulnerable to\\nchains and whips, which contradicted the delirium of the\\nfaces, less by the poverty of these trappings than by the\\nhuman truth which radiated from all that unprofaned flesh.\\nThe man in the tricorne is not mad because he has stuck an\\nold hat upon his nakedness; but within this madman in a hat\\nrises—by the inarticulate power of his muscular body, of\\nhis savage and marvelously unconstricted youth—a human\\npresence already liberated and somehow free since the beginning of time, by his birthright. The Madhouse is less\\nconcerned with madness and those strange faces one finds\\nelsewhere in the Caprichos, moreover, than with the vast\\nmonotony of these new bodies, shown in all their vigor,\\nand whose gestures, if they invoke their dreams, celebrate\\nespecially their dark freedom: its language is close to the\\nworld of Pinel.\\n\\n(279)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nManpness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nThe Goya of the Disparates and the Quinta del Sordo\\naddresses himself to another madness. Not that of madmen\\ncast into prison, but that of man cast into darkness. Does\\nGoya not link us, by memory, with the old world of enchantments, of fantastic rides, of witches perched on the\\nbranches of dead trees? Is not the monster whispering its\\nsecrets into the ears of the Monk related to the gnome who\\nfascinated Bosch’s Saint Anthony? But they are different\\nfor Goya, and their prestige, which overshadows all his\\nlater work, derives from another power. For Bosch or\\nBrueghel, these forms are generated by the world itself;\\nthrough the fissures of a strange poetry, they rise from\\nstones and plants, they well out of an animal howl; the\\nwhole complicity of nature is not too much for their dance.\\nGoya’s forms are born out of nothing: they have no background, in the double sense that they are silhouetted against\\nonly the most monotonous darkness, and that nothing can\\nassign them their origin, their limit, and their nature. The\\nDisparates are without landscape, without walls, without\\nsetting—and this is still a further difference from the\\nCaprichos; there is not a star in the night sky of the great\\nhuman bats we see in the Way of Flying. The branch on\\nwhich these witches jabber—out of what tree does it grow?\\nDoes it fly? Toward what sabbath, and what clearing?\\nNothing in all this deals with a world, neither this one\\nnor any other. It is indeed a question of that Sleep of\\nReason which Goya, in 1797, had already made the first\\nimage of the “universal idiom”; it is a question of a night\\nwhich is doubtless that of classical unreason, that triple\\nnight into which Orestes sank. But in that night, man\\ncommunicates with what is deepest in himself, and with\\nwhat is most solitary. The desert of Bosch’s Saint Anthony\\nwas infinitely populous; and even if it was a product of her\\nimagination, the landscape that Dulle Griet moved through\\nwas marked by a whole human language. Goya’s Monk,\\n\\n(280)\\n\\x0c Conclusion\\n\\nwith that hot beast against his back, its paws on his shoul~\\nders and its mouth panting at his ear, remains alone: no\\nsecret is revealed. All that is present is the most internal,\\nand at the same time the most savagely free, of forces: the\\npower which hacks apart the bodies in the Gran Disparate,\\nwhich breaks free and assaults our eyes in the Raging Madness. Beyond that point, the faces themselves decompose;\\nthis is no longer the madness of the Caprichos, which tied\\non masks truer than the truth of faces; this is a madness\\nbeneath the mask, a madness that eats away faces, corrodes\\nfeatures; there are no longer eyes or mouths, but glances\\nshot from nowhere and staring at nothing (as in the\\nWitches’ Sabbath); or screams from black holes (as in the\\nPilgrimage of Saint Isidore). Madness has become man’s\\npossibility of abolishing both man and the world—and even\\n_those images that challenge the world and deform man. It\\nis, far beyond dreams, beyond the nightmare of bestiality,\\nthe last recourse: the end and the beginning of everything.\\nNot because it is a promise, as in German lyricism, but\\nbecause it is the ambiguity of chaos and apocalypse: Goya’s\\nIdiot who shrieks and twists his shoulder to escape from the\\nnothingness that imprisons him—is this the birth of the first\\nman and his first movement toward liberty, or the last convulsion of the last dying man?\\n\\nAnd this madness that links and divides time, that twists\\nthe world into the ring of a single night, this madness so\\nforeign to the experience of its contemporaries, does it not\\ntransmit~to those able to receive it, to Nietzsche and to\\nArtaud—those barely audible voices of classical unreason,\\nin which it was always a question of nothingness and night,\\nbut amplifying them now to shrieks and frenzy? But giving\\nthem for the first time an expression, a droit de cité, and a\\nhold on Western culture which makes possible all contestations, as well as total contestation? But restoring their primitive savagery?\\n\\n(287)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nManpwess & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nSade’s calm, patient language also gathers up the final\\nwords of unreason and also gives them, for the future, a\\nremoter meaning. Between Goya’s broken drawings and\\nthat uninterrupted stream of words continuing from the\\nfirst volume of Justine to the tenth of Juliette, there is\\ndoubtless nothing in common except a certain movement\\nthat retraces the course of contemporary lyricism, drying\\nup its sources, rediscovering the secret of unreason’s nothingness.\\n\\nWithin the chateau where Sade’s hero confines himself,\\nwithin the convents, the forests, the dungeons where he\\nendlessly pursues the agony of his victims, it seems at first\\nglance thar nature can act with utter freedom. There man\\nrediscovers a truth he had forgotten, though it was manifest: what desire can be contrary to nature, since it was\\ngiven to man by nature itself? And since it was taught by\\nnature in the great lesson of life and death which never stops\\nrepeating itself in the world? The madness of desire, insane\\nmurders, the most unreasonable passions—all are wisdom\\nand reason, since they are a part of the order of nature.\\nEverything that morality and religion, everything that a\\nclumsy society has stifled in man, revives in the castle of\\nmurders, There man is finally attuned to his own nature; or\\nrather, by an ethic peculiar to this strange confinement,\\nman must scrupulously maintain, withour deviation, his\\nfidelity to nature: a strict task, a total enterprise: “You will\\nknow nothing unless you have known everything; if you\\nare timid enough to stop with Nature, she will escape you\\nforever.”* Conversely, if man has wounded or changed nature, it is man’s task to repair the damage through the\\nmathematics of a sovereign vengeance; “Nature caused us\\nall to be born equal; if fate is pleased to disturb this plan of\\nthe general law, it is our responsibility to correct its caprice, and to repair by our attention the usurpations of the\\nstronger.”? The slowness of revenge, like the insolence of\\n\\n(282)\\n\\x0c Conclusion\\n\\ndesire, belongs to nature. There is nothing that the madness\\nof men invents which is not either nature made manifest or\\nnature restored,\\n\\nBut this is only the first phase of Sade’s thought: the\\nironic justification, both rational and lyrical, the gigantic\\npastiche, of Rousseau. Beyond this demonstration-by-absurdity of the inanity of contemporary philosophy, beyond\\nall its verbiage about man and nature, the real decisions are\\nstill to be made: decisions that are also breaks, in which the\\nlinks between man and his natural being disappear.* The\\nfamous Society of the Friends of Crime, the project of a\\nSwedish Constitution, once we remove their stinging references to the Social Contract and to the proposed constitutions for Poland or Corsica, establish nothing but the sovereign rigor of subjectivity in the rejection of all natural\\nliberty and all natural equality: uncontrolled disposal of\\none member by the other, the unconditional exercise of\\nviolence, the limitless application of the right of death—this\\nentire society, whose only link is the very rejection of a\\nlink, appears to be a dismissal of nature—the only cohesion\\nasked of individuals is intended to protect, not a natural\\nexistence, but the free exercise of sovereignty over and\\nagainst nature.* The relation established by Rousseau is\\nprecisely reversed; sovereignty no longer transposes the\\nnatural existence; the latter is only an object for the sovereign, which permits him to measure his total liberty. Followed to its logical conclusion, desire leads only in ap;\\nance to the rediscovery of nature. Actually, for Sade there\\nis no return to the natal terrain, no hope that the first rejection of social order may surreptitiously become the reestablished order of happiness, through a dialectic of nature\\nrenouncing and thus confirming itself. The solitary madness of desire that still for Hegel, as for the eighteenthcentury philosophers, plunges man into a natural world that\\nis immediately resumed in a social world, for Sade merely\\n\\n(283)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nManvness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\ncasts man into a void that dominates nature in a total absence of proportion and community, into the endlessly repeated nonexistence of gratification. The night of madness\\nis thus limitless; what might have been supposed to be\\nman’s violent nature was only the infinity of non-nature.\\nHere is the source of Sade’s great monotony: as he advances, the settings dissolve; the surprises, the incidents, the\\npathetic or dramatic links of the scenes vanish. What was\\nstill vicissitude in Justine—an event experienced, hence\\nnew—becomes in Juliette a sovereign game, always triumphant, without negativity, and whose perfection is such\\nthat its novelty can only be its similarity to itself. As with\\nGoya, there are no longer any backgrounds for these meticulous Disparates. And yet in this absence of decor, which\\ncan as easily be total night as absolute day (there are no\\nshadows in Sade), we advance slowly toward a goal: the\\ndeath of Justine. Her innocence had exhausted even the\\ndesire to torment it. We cannot say that crime had not\\novercome her virtue; we must say inversely that her natural\\nvirtue had brought her to the point of having exhausted all\\nthe possible means of being an object for crime. And at this\\npoint, when crime can do nothing more than drive her\\nfrom the domain of its sovereignty (Juliette expels her\\nfrom the Chateau de Noirceuil), Nature in her turn, so\\nlong dominated, scorned, profaned,’ submits entirely to\\nthat which contradicted her: Nature in turn enters madness,\\nand there, in an instant, but for an instant only, restores her\\nomnipotence. The storm that is unleashed, the lightning\\nthat strikes and consumes Justine, is Nature become criminal subjectivity. This death that seems to escape from the\\ninsane domain of Juliette belongs to Nature more profoundly than any other; the night of storm, of thunder and\\nlightning, is a sufficient sign that Nature is lacerating herself,\\nthat she has reached the extreme point of her dissension,\\nand that she is revealing in this golden flash a sovereignty\\n\\n(284)\\n\\x0c  \\n\\nTranslated from the French by\\nRICHARD HOWARD\\n\\nVintage Books\\nA DIVISION OF RANDOM HOUSE\\n\\nNew York\\n\\x0c “Stultifera Navis”\\n\\nMonopolium et societas, vulgo des lichtschiffs. Finally, at\\nthe center of all these serious games, the great humanist\\ntexts: the Moria rediviva of Flayder and Erasmus’s Praise\\nof Folly. And confronting all these discussions, with their\\ntireless dialectic, confronting these discourses constantly\\nreworded and reworked, a long dynasty of images, from\\nHieronymus Bosch with The Cure of Madness and The\\nShip of Fools, down to Brueghel and his Dulle Griet;\\nwoodcuts and engravings transcribe what the theater, what\\nliterature and art have already taken up: the intermingled\\nthemes of the Feast and of the Dance of Fools. Indeed,\\nfrom the fifteenth century on, the face of madness has\\nhaunted the imagination of Western man.\\n\\nA sequence of dates speaks for itself: the Dance of\\nDeath in the Cimetiére des Innocents doubtless dates from\\nthe first years of the fifteenth century, the one in the\\nChaise-Dieu was probably composed around 1460; and it\\nwas in 1485 that Guyot Marchant published his Danse\\nmacabre, These sixty years, certainly, were dominated by\\nall this grinning imagery of Death. And it was in 1494 that\\nBrant wrote the Narrenschiff; in 1497 it was translated into\\nLatin. In the very last years of the century Hieronymus\\nBosch painted his Ship of Fools. The Praise of Folly dates\\nfrom 1509. The order of succession is clear.\\n\\nUp to the second half of the fifteenth century, or even a\\nlittle beyond, the theme of death reigns alone. The end of\\nman, the end of time bear the face of pestilence and war.\\nWhat overhangs human existence is this conclusion and this\\norder from which nothing escapes. The presence that\\nthreatens even within this world is a fleshless one. Then in\\nthe last years of the century this enormous uneasiness turns\\non itself; the mockery of madness replaces death and its\\nsolemnity. From the discovery of that necessity which inevitably reduces man to nothing, we have shifted to the\\nscornful contemplation of that nothing which is existence\\n\\n(75)\\n\\x0c  \\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nwhich is both herself and something quite outside herself:\\nthe sovereignty of a mad heart that has attained, in its solitude, the limits of the world that wounds it, that turns it\\nagainst itself and abolishes it at the moment when to have\\nmastered it so well gives it the right to identify itself with\\nthat world. That lighming-flash which Nature drew from\\nherself in order to strike Justine was identical with the long\\nexistence of Juliette, who would also disappear in solirude,\\nleaving no trace or corpse or anything upon which Nature\\ncould claim her due. The nothingness of unreason, in\\nwhich the language of Nature had died forever, has become a violence of Nature and against Nature, to the point\\nof the savage abolition of itself.°\\n\\nFor Sade as for Goya, unreason continues to watch by\\nnight; but in this vigil it joins with fresh powers. The nonbeing it once was now becomes the power to annihilate.\\nThrough Sade and Goya, the Western world received the\\npossibility of transcending its reason in violence, and of\\nrecovering tragic experience beyond the promises of dialectc.\\n\\nAfter Sade and Goya, and since them, unreason has belonged to whatever is decisive, for the modern world, in\\nany work of art: that is, whatever any work of art contains\\nthat is both murderous and constraining,\\n\\nThe madness of Tasso, the melancholia of Swift, the delrium of Rousseau belong to their works, just as these\\nworks belong to their authors, Here in the texts, there in\\nthe lives of the men, the same violence spoke, or the same\\nbitterness; visions certainly were exchanged; language and\\ndelirium interlaced. But further, the work of art and madness, in classical experience, were more profoundly united at\\nanother level: paradoxically, at the point where they limited one another. For there existed a region where madness\\nchallenged the work of art, reduced it ironically, made of\\n\\n(285)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMaoness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nits iconographic landscape a pathological world of hallucinations; thar language which was delirium was not a\\nwork of art. And conversely, delirium was robbed of its\\nmeager truth as madness if it was called a work of art. But\\nby admitting this very fact, there was no reduction of one\\nby the other, bur rather (remembering Montaigne) a discovery of the central incertitude where the work of art is\\nborn, at the moment when it stops being born and is truly a\\nwork of art. In this opposition, to which Tasso and Swift\\nbore witness after Lucretius—and which it was vain to attempt to separate into lucid intervals and crises—was disclosed a distance where the very truth of a work of art\\nraised a problem: was it madness, or a work of art? Inspiration, or hallucination? A spontaneous babble of words, or\\nthe pure origins of language? Must its truth, even before its\\nbirth, be taken from the wretched truth of men, or discovered far beyond its origin, in the being that it presumes?\\nThe madness of the writer was, for other men, the chance\\nto see being born, over and over again, in the discouragement of repetition and disease, the truth of the work of\\nart.\\nThe madness of Nietzsche, the madness of Van Gogh or\\nof Artaud, belongs to their work perhaps neither more nor\\nless profoundly, but in quite another way. The frequency\\nin the modern world of works of art that explode out of\\nmadness no doubt proves nothing about the reason of that\\nworld, about the meaning of such works, or even about the\\nrelations formed and broken between the real world and\\nthe artists who produced such works. And yer this frequency must be taken seriously, as if it were the insistence\\nof a question: from the time of Hélderlin and Nerval, the\\nnumber of writers, painters, and musicians who have “succumbed” to madness has increased; but let us make no mistake here; between madness and the work of art, there has\\nbeen no accommodation, no more constant exchange, no\\n\\n(286)\\n\\x0c Conclusion\\n\\ncommunication of languages; their opposition is much\\nmore dangerous than formerly; and their competition now\\nallows no quarter; theirs is a game of life and death. Artaud’s madness does not slip through the fissures of the\\nwork of art; his madness is precisely the absence of the\\nwork of art, the reiterated presence of that absence, its\\ncentral void experienced and measured in all its endless dimensions. Nietzsche’s last cry, proclaiming himself both\\nChrist and Dionysos, is not on the border of reason and\\nunreason, in the perspective of the work of art, their common dream, finally realized and immediately vanishing, of a\\nreconciliation of the “shepherds of Arcady and the fishermen of Tiberias”; it is the very annihilation of the work of\\nart, the point where it becomes impossible and where it\\nmust fall silent; the hammer has just fallen from the philosopher’s hands. And Van Gogh, who did not want to ask\\n“permission from doctors to paint pictures,” knew quite\\nwell chat his work and his madness were incompatible,\\nMadness is the absolute break with the work of art; it\\nforms the constitutive moment of abolition, which dissolves\\nin time the truth of the work of art; it draws the exterior\\nedge, the line of dissolution, the contour against the void.\\nArtaud’s oeuvre experiences its own absence in madness, but\\nthat experience, the fresh courage of that ordeal, all those\\nwords hurled against a fundamental absence of language,\\nall that space of physical suffering and terror which surrounds or rather coincides with the void—that is the work\\nof art itself: the sheer cliff over the abyss of the work’s\\nabsence. Madness is no longer the space of indecision\\nthrough which it was possible to glimpse the original truth\\nof the work of art, but the decision beyond which this\\ntruth ceases irrevocably, and hangs forever over history, It\\nis of little importance on exactly which day in the autumn\\nof 1888 Nietzsche went mad for good, and after which his\\ntexts no longer afford philosophy but psychiatry: all of\\n\\n(287)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMaAvNESS & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nthem, including the postcard to Strindberg, belong to\\nNietzsche, and all are related to The Birth of Tragedy. But\\nwe must not think of this continuity in terms of a system,\\nof a thematics, or even of an existence: Nietzsche’s madness—that is, the dissolution of his thought—is that by\\nwhich his thought opens out onto the modern world. What\\nmade it impossible makes it immediate for us; what took it\\nfrom Nietzsche offers it to us. This does not mean that\\nmadness is the only language common to the work of art\\nand the modern world (dangers of the pathos of malediction, inverse and symmetrical danger of psychoanalyses) ;\\nbut it means that, through madness, a work that seems to\\ndrown in the world, to reveal there its non-sense, and to\\ntransfigure itself with the features of pathology alone, actually engages within itself the world’s time, masters it, and\\nleads it; by the madness which interrupts it, a work of art\\nopens a void, a moment of silence, a question without answer, provokes a breach without reconciliation where the\\nworld is forced to question itself. What is necessarily a\\nprofanation in the work of art returns to that point, and, in\\nthe time of that work swamped in madness, the world is\\nmade aware of its guilt. Henceforth, and through the mediation of madness, it is the world that becomes culpable\\n(for the first time in the Western world) in relation to the\\nwork of art; it is now arraigned by the work of art, obliged\\nto order itself by its language, compelled by it to a task of\\nrecognition, of reparation, to the task of restoring reason\\nfrom that unreason and to that unreason. The madness in\\nwhich the work of art is engulfed is the space of our enterprise, it is the endless path to fulfillment, it is our mixed vocation of apostle and exegete, This is why it makes little\\ndifference when the first voice of madness insinuated itself\\ninto Nietzsche’s pride, into Van Gogh’s humility. There is\\nno madness except as the final instant of the work of art—\\nthe work endlessly drives madness to its limits; where there\\n\\n(288)\\n\\x0c Conclusion\\n\\nis a work of art, there is no madness; and yet madness is\\ncontemporary with the work of art, since it inaugurates\\nthe time of its truch. The moment when, together, the work\\nof art and madness are born and fulfilled is the beginning\\nof the time when the world finds itself arraigned by that\\nwork of art and responsible before it for what it is.\\n\\nRuse and new triumph of madness: the world that\\nthought to measure and justify madness through psychology must justify itself before madness, since in its struggles\\nand agonies it measures itself by the excess of works like\\nthose of Nietzsche, of Van Gogh, of Artaud. And nothing\\nin itself, especially not what it can know of madness, assures the world that it is justified by such works of madness.\\n\\n \\n\\x0c \\x0c NOTES\\n\\ncHaPTer 1. “Struciirera Navis”\\n\\nCf.

Fear in the face of the absolute limit of death turns\\ninward in a continuous irony; man disarms it in advance,\\nmaking it an object of derision by giving it an everyday,\\ntamed form, by constantly renewing it in the spectacle of\\nlife, by scattering it throughout the vices, the difficulties,\\nand the absurdities of all men. Death’s annihilation is no\\nlonger anything because it was already everything, because\\nlife itself was only futility, vain words, a squabble of cap\\nand bells. The head that will become a skull is already\\nempty. Madness is the déja-a of death.‘ But it is also its\\nvanquished presence, evaded in those everyday signs\\nwhich, announcing that death reigns already, indicate that\\nits prey will be a sorry prize indeed. What death unmasks\\nwas never more than a mask; to discover the grin of the\\nskeleton, one need only lift off something that was neither\\nbeauty nor truth, but only a plaster and tinsel face. From\\nthe vain mask to the corpse, the same smile persists. But\\nwhen the madman laughs, he already laughs with the laugh\\nof death; the lunatic, anticipating the macabre, has disarmed it. The cries of Dulle Griet triumph, in the high\\nRenaissance, over that Triumph of Death sung at the end\\nof the Middle Ages on the walls of the Campo Santo.\\n\\nThe substitution of the theme of madness for that of\\ndeath does not mark a break, but rather a torsion within the\\nsame anxiery. Whar is in question is still the nothingness of\\nexistence, but this nothingness is no longer considered an\\nexternal, final term, both threat and conclusion; it is experienced from within as the continuous and constant form\\nof existence. And where once man’s madness had been not\\nto see that death’s term was approaching, so that it was\\nnecessary to recall him to wisdom with the spectacle of death, now wisdom consisted of denouncing madness\\neverywhere, teaching men that they were no more than\\ndead men already, and that if the end was near, it was to\\nthe degree that madness, become universal, would be one\\n\\n(76)\\n\\x0c vi\\n8.\\n\\n10,\\n1.\\n\\n32,\\n\\n13.\\n\\n14.\\n\\n19.\\n20.\\n\\n21.\\n22.\\n23.\\n\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nApologie pour Monsieur Duncan.\\n\\nThomas Willis, Opera onmia (Lyons, 1681), Vol. I, p. 242.\\n“A soldier became melancholic because of his parents’ rejection of a girl he desperately loved.

He\\nfectured in many universities throughout the world and\\nserved as director at the Institut Frangais in Hamburg, and\\nthe Insticut de Philosophie at the Faculté des Lettres in the\\nUniversity of Clermont-Ferrand. He wrote frequently for\\nFrench newspapers and reviews, and held a chair at France\\'s\\nmost prestigious institution, the Collége de France.\\n\\nIn addition to Madness and Civilization, his works available\\nin Vintage are The Order of Things, The Birth of the Clinic,\\nDiscipline and Punish, and The History of Sexuality.\\n\\nMichel Foucault died in June 1984.\\n\\n \\n\\x0c \\x0c “Stultifera Navis”\\n\\nand the same with death itself. This is what Eustache Deschamps prophesies:\\n\\nWe are cowardly and weak,\\nCovetous, old, evil-tongued.\\nFools are all I see, in truth,\\nThe end is near,\\nAllgoesill...\\n\\nThe elements are now reversed. It is no longer the end of\\ntime and of the world which will show retrospectively that\\nmen were mad not to have been prepared for them; it is the\\ntide of madness, its secret invasion, that shows that the\\nworld is near its final catastrophe; it is man’s insanity that\\ninvokes and makes necessary the world’s end.\\n\\nIn its various forms—plastic or literary—this experience\\nof madness seems extremely coherent. Painting and text\\nconstantly refer to one another—commentary here and illustration there. We find the same theme of the Narrentanz\\nover and over in popular festivals, in theatrical performances, in engravings and woodcuts, and the entire last part\\nof the Praise of Folly is constructed on the model of a long\\ndance of madmen in which each profession and each estate\\nparades in turn to form the great round of unreason. It is\\nlikely that in Bosch’s Temptation of Saint Anthony in Lisbon, many figures of the fantastic fauna which invade the\\ncanvas are borrowed from traditional masks; some perhaps\\nare transferred from the Malleus maleficarum. As for the\\nfamous Ship of Fools, is it not a direct translation of\\nBrant’s Narrenschiff, whose title it bears, and of which it\\nseems to illustrate quite precisely canto XXVII, also consecrated to stigmatizing “drunkards and gluttons”? It has\\neven been suggested that Bosch’s painting was part of a\\nseries of pictures illustrating the principal cantos of Brant’s\\npoem.\\n\\n(27)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nAs a matter of fact, we must not be misled by what\\nappears to be a strict continuity in these themes, nor imagine more than is revealed by history itself. It is unlikely that\\nan analysis like the one Emile Male worked out for the preceding epochs, especially apropos of the theme of death,\\ncould be repeated. Between word and image, between what\\nis depicted by language and what is uttered by plastic form,\\nthe unity begins to dissolve; a single and identical meaning\\nis not immediately common to them. And if it is true that\\nthe image still has the function of speaking, of transmitting\\nsomething consubstantial with language, we must recognize\\nthat it already no longer says the same thing; and that by its\\nown plastic values painting engages in an experiment that\\nwill take it farther and farther from language, whatever the\\nsuperficial identity of the theme. Figure and speech still\\nillustrate the same fable of folly in the same moral world,\\nbut already they take two different directions, indicating,\\nin a stil] barely perceptible scission, what will be the great\\nline of cleavage in the Western experience of madness.\\n\\nThe dawn of madness on the horizon of the Renaissance\\nis first perceptible in the decay of Gothic symbolism; as if\\nthat world, whose network of spiritual meanings was so\\nclose-knit, had begun to unravel, showing faces whose\\nmeaning was no longer clear except in the forms of madness. The Gothic forms persist for a time, but little by little\\nthey grow silent, cease to speak, to remind, to teach anything but their own fantastic presence, transcending all\\npossible language (though still familiar to the eye). Freed\\nfrom wisdom and from the teaching that organized it, the\\nimage begins to gravitate about its own madness.\\n\\nParadoxically, this liberation derives from a proliferation\\nof meaning, from a self-multiplication of significance,\\nweaving relationships so numerous, so intertwined, so rich,\\nthat they can no longer be deciphered except in the esoterism of knowledge. Things themselves become so burdened\\n\\n(78)\\n\\x0c  \\n\\n“Stultifera Navis”\\n\\nwith attributes, signs, allusions that they finally lose their\\nown form. Meaning is no longer read in an immediate perception, the figure no longer speaks for itself; between the\\nknowledge which animates it and the form into which it is\\ntransposed, a gap widens. It is free for the dream. One book\\nbears witness to meaning’s proliferation at the end of the\\nGothic world, the Speculum humanae salvationis, which,\\nbeyond all the correspondences established by the patristic\\ntradition, elaborates, berween the Old and the New Testament, a symbolism not on the order of Prophecy, but deriving from an equivalence of imagery. The Passion of Christ\\nis not prefigured only by the sacrifice of Abraham; it is\\nsurrounded by all the glories of torture and its innumerable\\ndreams; Tubal the blacksmith and Isaiah’s wheel take their\\nplaces around the Cross, forming beyond all the lessons of\\nthe sacrifice the fantastic tableau of savagery, of tormented\\nbodies, and of suffering. Thus the image is burdened with\\nsupplementary meanings, and forced to express them, And\\ndreams, madness, the unreasonable can also slip into this\\nexcess of meaning. The symbolic figures easily become\\nnightmare silhouettes. Witness that old image of wisdom so\\noften translated, in German engravings, by a long-necked\\nbird whose thoughts, rising slowly from heart to head,\\nhave time to be weighed and reflected on; a symbol whose\\nvalues are blunted by being overemphasized: the long path\\nof reflection becomes in the image the alembic of a subrle\\nlearning, an instrument which distills quintessences. The\\nneck of the Gutemensch is endlessly elongated, the better\\nto illustrate, beyond wisdom, all the real mediations of\\nknowledge; and the symbolic man becomes a fantastic bird\\nwhose disproportionate neck folds a thousand times upon\\nitself—an insane being, halfway between animal and thing,\\ncloser to the charms of an image than to the rigor of a\\nmeaning. This symbolic wisdom is a prisoner of the madness of dreams.\\n\\n(t9)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMADNESS & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nA fundamental conversion of the world of images: the\\nconstraint of a multiplied meaning liberates that world\\nfrom the control of form. So many diverse meanings are\\nestablished beneath the surface of the image that it presents\\nonly an enigmatic face. And its power is no longer to teach\\nbut to fascinate. Characteristic is the evolution of the\\nfamous gryllos already familiar to the Middle Ages in the\\nEnglish psalters, and at Chartres and Bourges. It taught,\\nthen, how the soul of desiring man had become a prisoner\\nof the beast; these grotesque faces set in the bellies of monsters belonged to the world of the great Platonic metaphor\\nand denounced the spirit’s corruption in the folly of sin.\\nBut in the fifteenth century the gryllos, image of human\\nmadness, becomes one of the preferred figures in the countless Temptations. What assails the hermit’s tranquillity is\\nnot objects of desire, but these hermetic, demented forms\\nwhich have risen from a dream, and remain silent and furtive on the surface of a world. In the Lisbon Temptation,\\nfacing Saint Anthony sits one of these figures born of madness, of its solitude, of its penitence, of its privations, a wan\\nsmile lights this bodiless face, the pure presence of anxiety\\nin the form of an agile grimace. Now it is exactly this\\nnightmare silhouette that is at once the subject and object\\nof the temptation; it is this figure which fascinates the gaze\\nof the ascetic—both are prisoners of a kind of mirror interrogation, which remains unanswered in a silence inhabited\\nonly by the monstrous swarm that surrounds them, The\\ngryllos no longer recalls man, by its satiric form, to his\\nspiritual vocation forgotten in the folly of desire. It is madness become Temptation; all it embodies of the impossible,\\nthe fantastic, the inhuman, all that suggests the unnatural,\\nthe writhing of an insane presence on the earth’s surface—\\nali this is precisely what gives the gryllos its strange power.\\nThe freedom, however frightening, of his dreams, the hallucinations of his madness, have more power of attraction\\n\\n(20)\\n\\x0c  \\n\\n \\n\\n“Stultifera Nevis”\\n\\nfor fifteenth-century man than the desirable reality of the\\nflesh,\\n\\nWhat then is this fascination which now operates\\nthrough the images of madness?\\n\\nFirst, man finds in these fantastic figures one of the secrets and one of the vocations of his nature. In the thought\\nof the Middle Ages, the legions of animals, named once and\\nfor all by Adam, symbolically bear the values of humanity.\\nBut at the beginning of the Renaissance, the relations with\\nanimality are reversed; the beast is set free; it escapes the\\nworld of legend and moral illustration to acquire a fantastic\\nnature of its own. And by an astonishing reversal, it is now\\nthe animal that will stalk man, capture him, and reveal him\\nto his own truth. Impossible animals, issuing from a demented imagination, become the secret nature of man; and\\nwhen on the Last Day sinful man appears in his hideous\\nnakedness, we see that he has the monstrous shape of a\\ndelirious animal; these are the screech owls whose toad\\nbodies combine, in Thierry Bouts’s Hell, with the nakedness\\nof the damned; these are Stephan Lochner’s winged insects\\nwith cats’ heads, sphinxes with beetles’ wing cases, birds\\nwhose wings are as disturbing and as avid as hands; this is\\nthe great beast of prey with knotty fingers that figures in\\nMatthias Griinewald’s Temptation. Animality has escaped\\ndomestication by human symbols and values; and it is animality that reveals the dark rage, the sterile madness that\\nlie in men’s hearts.\\n\\nAt the opposite pole to this nature of shadows, madness\\nfascinates because it is knowledge. It is knowledge, first,\\nbecause all these absurd figures are in reality elements of a\\ndifficult, hermetic, esoteric learning. These strange forms\\nare situated, from the first, in the space of the Great Secret,\\nand the Saint Anthony who is tempted by them is not a\\nvictim of the violence of desire but of the much more insidious lure of curiosity; he is tempted by that distance and\\n\\n(27)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavoness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nintimate knowledge which is offered, and at the same time\\nevaded, by the smile of the gryllos; his backward movement is nothing but that step by which he keeps from cross~\\ning the forbidden limits of knowledge; he knows already—\\nand that is his temptation—what Jéréme Cardan will say\\nlater: “Wisdom, like other precious substances, must be\\ntorn from the bowels of the earth.” This knowledge, so\\ninaccessible, so formidable, the Fool, in his innocent idiocy,\\nalready possesses, While the man of reason and wisdom\\nperceives only fragmentary and all the more unnerving\\nimages of it, the Fool bears it intact as an unbroken sphere:\\nthat crystal ball which for all others is empty is in his eyes\\nfilled with the density of an invisible knowledge. Brueghel\\nmocks the sick man who tries to penetrate this crystal\\nsphere, but it is this iridescent bubble of knowledge—an\\nabsurd but infinitely precious Jantern—that sways at the\\nend of the stick Dulle Griet bears on her shoulder. And it is\\nthis sphere which figures on the reverse of the Garden of\\nDelights. Another symbol of knowledge, the tree (the forbidden tree, the tree of promised immortality and of sin),\\nonce planted in the heart of the earthly paradise, has been\\nuprooted and now forms the mast of the Ship of Fools, as\\nseen in the engraving that illustrates Josse Bade’s Srultiferae\\nnaviculae; it is this tree, without a doubt, that sways over\\nBosch’s Ship of Fools.\\n\\nWhar does it presage, this wisdom of fools? Doubtless,\\nsince it is a forbidden wisdom, it presages both the reign of\\nSatan and the end of the world; ultimate bliss and supreme\\npunishment; omnipotence on earth and the infernal fall.\\nThe Ship of Fools sails through a landscape of delights,\\nwhere all is offered to desire, a sort of renewed paradise,\\nsince here man no longer knows either suffering or need;\\nand yet he has not recovered his innocence. This false happiness is the diabolical triumph of the Antichrist; it is the\\n\\n(22)\\n\\x0c “Stultifera Navis”\\n\\nEnd, already at hand. Apocalyptic dreams are not new, it\\nis true, in the fifteenth century; they are, however, very\\ndifferent in nature from what they had been earlier. The\\ndelicately fantastic iconography of the fourteenth century,\\nwhere castles are toppled like dice, where the Beast is always the traditional dragon held at bay by the Virgin, in\\nshort where the order of God and its imminent victory are\\nalways apparent, gives way to a vision of the world where\\nall wisdom is annihilated. This is the great witches’ Sabbath\\nof nature: mountains melt and become plains, the earth\\nvomits up the dead and bones tumble out of tombs; the\\nstars fall, the earth catches fire, all life withers and comes to\\ndeath. The end has no value as passage and promise; it is the\\nadvent of a night in which the world’s old reason is engulfed. It is enough to look at Diirer’s Horsemen of the\\nApocalypse, sent by God Himself: these are no angels of\\ntriumph and reconciliation; these are no heralds of serene\\njustice, but the disheveled warriors of a mad vengeance,\\nThe world sinks into universal Fury. Victory is neither\\nGod\\'s nor the Devil’s: it belongs to Madness.\\n\\nOn all sides, madness fascinates man. The fantastic images it generates are not fleeting appearances that quickly\\ndisappear from the surface of things. By a strange paradox,\\nwhat is born from the strangest delirium was already hidden, like a secret, like an inaccessible truth, in the bowels of\\nthe earth. When man deploys the arbitrary nature of his\\nmadness, he confronts the dark necessity of the world; the\\nanimal that haunts his nightmares and his nights of privation is his own nature, which will lay bare hell’s pitiless\\ntruth; the vain images of blind idiocy—such are the world’s\\nMagna Scientia; and already, in this disorder, in this mad\\nuniverse, is prefigured what will be the cruelty of the finale, In such images—and this is doubtless what gives them\\ntheir weight, what imposes such great coherence on their\\n\\n(23)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavness & CivILIZATION\\n\\nfantasy—the Renaissance has expressed what it apprehended of the threats and secrets of the world.\\n\\nDuring the same period, the literary, philosophical, and\\nmoral theres of madness are in an altogether different vein.\\n\\nThe Middle Ages had given madness, or folly, a place\\nin the hierarchy of vices, Beginning with the thirteenth\\ncentury, it is customarily ranked among the wicked soldiers\\nof the psychomachy. It figures, at Paris as at Amiens, among\\nthe evil soldiery, and is among the twelve dualities that dispute the sovereignty of the human soul: Faith and Idolatry,\\nHope and Despair, Charity and Avarice, Chastity and Lust,\\nPrudence and Folly, Patience and Anger, Gentleness and\\nHarshness, Concord and Discord, Obedience and Rebellion, Perseverance and Inconstancy, Fortirude and Cowardice, Humility and Pride. In the Renaissance, Folly leaves\\nthis modest place and comes to the fore. Whereas according to Hugues de Saint-Victor the genealogical tree of the\\nVices, that of the Old Adam, had pride as its root, Folly\\nnow leads the joyous throng of all human weaknesses, Uncontested coryphaeus, she guides them, sweeps them on,\\nand names them: “Recognize them here, in the group of\\nmy companions. ,.. She whose brows are drawn is Philautia\\n(Self-Love), She whom you see laugh with her eyes and\\napplaud .with her hands is Colacia (Flattery). She who\\nseems half asleep is Lethe (Forgetfulness). She who leans\\nupon her elbows and folds her hands is Misoponia (Sloth).\\nShe who is crowned with roses and anointed with perfume\\nis Hedonia (Sensuality). She whose eyes wander without\\nseeing is Anoia (Stupidity). She whose abundant flesh has\\nthe hue of flowers is Tryphé (Indolence). And here among\\nthese young women are two gods: the god of Good Cheer\\nand the god of Deep Sleep.”* The absolute privilege of\\nFolly is to reign over whatever is bad in man. But does she\\nnot also reign indirectly over all the good he can do: over\\nambition, that makes wise politicians; over avarice, that\\n\\n(24)\\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMADNESS\\n\\nAND\\n\\nCIVILIZATION\\n\\ncA History of Insanity in the\\nAge of ‘Reason\\n\\nMICHEL\\nFOUCAULT\\n\\nShes\\n\\n \\n\\x0c “Stultifera Navis”\\n\\nmakes wealth grow; over indiscreet curiosity, that inspires\\nphilosophers and men of learning? Louise Labé merely follows Erasmus when she has Mercury implore the gods:\\n“Do not let that beautiful Lady perish who has given you\\nso much pleasure.”\\n\\nBut this new royalty has little in common with the dark\\nreign of which we were just speaking and which communicated with the great tragic powers of this world,\\n\\nTrue, madness attracts, but it does not fascinate. It rules\\nall that is easy, joyous, frivolous in the world, It is madness,\\nfolly, which makes men “sport and rejoice,” as it has given\\nthe gods “Genius, Beauty, Bacchus, Silenus, and the gentle\\nguardian of gardens.” * All within it is brilliant surface: no\\nenigma is concealed.\\n\\nNo doubt, madness has something to do with the strange\\npaths of knowledge. The first canto of Brant’s poem is\\ndevoted to books and scholars; and in the engraving which\\nillustrates this passage in the Latin edition of 1497, we see\\nenthroned upon his bristling cathedra of books the Magister who wears behind his doctoral cap a fool’s cap sewn\\nwith bells. Erasmus, in his dance of fools, reserves a large\\nplace for scholars: after the Grammarians, the Poets, Rhetoricians, and Writers, come the Jurists; after them, the\\n“Philosophers respectable in beard and mantle”; finally the\\nnumberless troop of the Theologians. But if knowledge is\\nso important in madness, it is not because the latter can\\ncontrol the secrets of knowledge; on the contrary, madness\\nis the punishment of a disorderly and useless science. If\\nmadness is the truth of knowledge, it is because knowledge\\nis absurd, and instead of addressing itself to the great book\\nof experience, loses its way in the dust of books and in idle\\ndebate; learning becomes madness through the very excess\\nof false learning.\\n\\nO vos doctores, qui grandia nomina fertis\\nRespicite antiquos patris, jurisque peritos.\\n\\n(25)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavNESS & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nNon in candidulis pensebant dogmata libris,\\nArte sed ingenua sitibundum pectus alebant.?\\n\\n(O ye learned men, who bear great names,\\n\\nLook back at the ancient fathers, learned in the law.\\nThey did not weigh dogmas in shining white books,\\nBut fed their thirsty hearts with nacural skill.)\\n\\nAccording to the theme long familiar to popular satire,\\nmadness appears here as the comic punishment of knowledge and its ignorant presumption.\\n\\nIn a general way, then, madness is not linked to the\\nworld and its subterranean forms, but rather to man, to his\\nweaknesses, dreams, and illusions. Whatever obscure cosmic manifestation there was in madness as seen by Bosch is\\nwiped out in Erasmus; madness no longer lies in wait for\\nmankind at the four corners of the earth; it insinuates itself\\nwithin man, or rather it is a subtle rapport that man maintains with himself, The mythological personification of\\nmadness in Erasmus is only a literary device. In fact, only\\n“follies” exist—human forms of madness: “I count as many\\nimages as there are men”; one need only glance at states,\\neven the wisest and best governed: “So many forms of\\nmadness abound there, and each day sees so many new ones\\nborn, that a thousand Democrituses would not suffice to\\nmock them.” There is no madness but that which is in\\nevery man, since it is man who constitutes madness in the\\nattachment he bears for himself and by the illusions he\\nentertains. Philautia is the first figure Folly leads out in\\nher dance, but that is because they are linked by a privileged relation: self-attachment is the first sign of madness,\\nbut it is because man is artached to himself that he accepts\\nerror as truth, lies as reality, violence and ugliness as beauty\\nand justice. “This man, uglier than a monkey, imagines\\nhimself handsome as Nereus; that one thinks he is Euclid\\nbecause he has traced three lines with a compass; that other\\n\\n(26)\\n\\x0c “Stultifera Navis”\\n\\none thinks he can sing like Hermogenes, whereas he is the\\nass before the lyre, and his voice sounds as false as that of\\nthe rooster pecking his hen.” In this delusive attachment to\\nhimself, man generates his madness like a mirage. The symbol of madness will henceforth be that mirror which, without reflecting anything real, will secretly offer the man\\nwho observes himself in it the dream of his own presumption. Madness deals not so much with truth and the world,\\nas with man and whatever truth about himself he is able to\\nperceive.\\n\\nIt thus gives access to a completely moral universe. Evil\\nis not punishment or the end of time, but only fault and\\nflaw. A hundred and sixteen cantos of Brant’s poem are de~\\nvoted to portraits of the insane passengers on the Ship:\\nthere are misers, slanderers, drunkards; there are those who\\nindulge in disorder and debauchery; those who interpret\\nthe Scriptures falsely; those who practice adultery. Locher,\\nBrant’s translator, notes in his Latin preface the purpose\\nand meaning of the work; it is concerned to teach “what\\nevil there may be, what good; what vices, whither virme,\\nwhither error may lead”; and this while castigating, according to the wickedness each man is guilty of, “the unholy,\\nthe proud, the greedy, the extravagant, the debauched, the\\nvoluptuous, the quick-tempered, the gluttonous, the voracious, the envious, the poisoners, the faith-breakers” . . .\\nin short, af] that man has been able to invent in the way of\\nirregularities in his conduct.\\n\\nIn the domain of literary and philosophic expression, the\\nexperience of madness in the fifteenth century generally\\ntakes the form of moral satire. Nothing suggests those great\\nthreats of invasion that haunted the imagination of the\\npainters. On the contrary, great pains are taken to ward it\\noff; one does not speak of such things. Erasmus turns our\\ngaze from that insanity “which the Furies let slip from hell,\\neach time they release their serpents”; ic is not these insane\\n\\n(27)\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMapness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nforms that he has chosen to praise, but the “sweet illusion”\\nthat frees the soul from “its painful cares and returns it to\\nthe various forms of sensuality.” This calm world is easily\\nmastered; it readily yields its naive mysteries to the eyes of\\nthe wise man, and the latter, by laughter, always keeps his\\ndistance. Whereas Bosch, Brueghel, and Diirer were tertibly earth-bound spectators, implicated in that madness\\nthey saw surging around them, Erasmus observes it from\\nfar enough away to be out of danger; he observes it from\\nthe heights of his Olympus, and if he sings its praises, it is\\nbecause he can laugh at it with the inextinguishable laughter of the Gods. For the madness of men is a divine spectacle: “In fact, could one make observations from the\\nMoon, as did Menippus, considering the numberless agitations of the Earth, one would think one saw a swarm of\\nflies or gnats fighting among themselves, struggling and laying traps, stealing from one another, playing, gamboling,\\nfalling, and dying, and one would not believe the troubles,\\nthe tragedies that were produced by such a minute animalcule destined to perish so shortly.” Madness is no longer\\nthe familiar foreignness of the world; it is merely a commonplace spectacle for the foreign spectator; no longer a\\nfigure of the cosmos, but a characteristic of the aevum.\\n\\nBut a new enterprise was being undertaken that would\\nabolish the tragic experience of madness in a critical consciousness. Let us ignore this phenomenon for the moment\\nand consider indiscriminately those figures to be found in\\nDon Quixote as well as in Scudéry’s novels, in King Lear as\\nwell as in the theater of Jean de Rotrou or Tristan \\'Hermite.\\n\\nLet us begin with the most important, and the most dutable—since the eighteenth century will still recognize its\\nonly just erased forms: madness by romantic identification.\\nIts features have been fixed once and for all by Cervantes.\\nBut the theme is tirelessly repeated: direct adaptations (the\\n\\n(28)\\n\\x0c “Stultifera Navis”\\n\\nDon Quichotte of Guérin de Bouscal was performed in\\n1639; two years later, he staged Le Gouvernement de\\nSancho Panga), reinterpretations of a particular episode\\n(Pichou’s Les Folies de Cardenio is a variation on the theme\\nof the “Ragged Knight” of the Sierra Morena), or, in a\\nmore indirect fashion, satire on novels of fantasy (as in\\nSubligny’s La Fausse Clélie, and within the story itself, as in\\nthe episode of Julie d@’Arviane). The chimeras are transmitted from author to reader, but what was fantasy on one\\nside becomes hallucination on the other; the writer’s stratagem is quite naively accepted as an image of reality. In\\nappearance, this is nothing but the simple-minded critique\\nof novels of fantasy, but just under the surface lies an\\nenormous anxiety concerning the relationships, in a work\\nof art, between the real and the imaginary, and perhaps also\\nconcerning the confused communication between fantastic\\ninvention and the fascinations of delirium. “We owe the\\ninvention of the arts to deranged imaginations; the Caprice\\nof Painters, Poets, and Musicians is only a name moderated\\nin civility to express their Madness.” ® Madness, in which\\nthe values of another age, another art, another morality are\\ncalled into question, but which also reflects—blurred and\\ndisturbed, strangely compromised by one another in 2\\ncommon chimera-—all the forms, even the most remote, of\\nthe human imagination.\\n\\nImmediately following this first form: the madness of vain\\npresumption. But it is not with a literary model thar the\\nmadman identifies; it is with himself, and by means of a\\ndelusive attachment that enables him to grant himself all\\nthe qualities, all the virtues or powers he lacks. He inherits\\nthe old Philautia of Erasmus. Poor, he is rich; ugly, he admires himself; with chains still on his feet, he takes himself\\nfor God. Such a one was Osuma’s master of arts who beHeved he was Neptune. Such is the ridiculous fate of the\\nseven characters of Desmarets de Saint-Sorlin’s Les Vision\\n(29)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavpNeEss & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nnaires, of Chateaufort in Cyrano de Bergerac’s Le Pédant\\njoué, of M. de Richesource in Sir Politik. Measureless madness, which has as many faces as the world has characters,\\nambitions, and necessary illusions. Even in its extremities,\\nthis is the least extreme of madnesses; it is, in the heart of\\nevery man, the imaginary relation he maintains with himself. It engenders the commonest of his faults. ‘To denounce\\nit is the first and last element of all moral criticism.\\n\\nTo the moral world, also, belongs the madness of just\\npunishment, which chastises, along with the disorders of\\nthe mind, those of the heart. Bur it has still other powers:\\nthe punishment it inflicts multiplies by nature insofar as,\\nby punishing itself, it unveils the truth, The justification\\nof this madness is that it is truthful. Truthful since the\\nsufferer already experiences, in the vain whirlwind of his\\nhallucinations, what will for all eternity be the pain of his\\npunishment: Eraste, in Corneille’s Mélite, sees himself already pursued by the Eumenides and condemned by\\nMinos, Truthful, too, because the crime hidden from all\\neyes dawns like day in the night of this strange punishment;\\nmadness, in its wild, untamable words, proclaims its own\\nmeaning; in its chimeras, it utters its secret truth; its cries\\nspeak for its conscience. Thus Lady Macbeth’s delirium\\nreveals to those who “have known what they should not”\\nwords long uttered only to “dead pillows.”\\n\\nThen the last type of madness: that of desperate passion.\\nLove disappointed in its excess, and especially love deceived\\nby the fatality of death, has no other recourse but madness.\\nAs long as there was an object, mad love was more love\\nthan madness; left to itself, it pursues itself in the void of\\ndelirium. Punishment of a passion too abjectly abandoned\\nto its violence? No. doubt; but this punishment is also a\\nrelief; it spreads, over the irreparable absence, the mercy of\\nimaginary presences; it recovers, in the paradox of innocent\\njoy or in the heroism of senseless pursuits, the vanished\\n\\n(30)\\n\\x0c  \\n\\n“Stultifera Navis”\\n\\nform. If it leads to death, it is a death in which the lovers\\nwill never be separated again. This is Ophelia’s last song, this\\nis the delirium of Ariste in La Folie du sage. But above all,\\nthis is the bitter and sweet madness of King Lear.\\n\\nIn Shakespeare, madness is allied to death and murder; in\\nCervantes, images are controlled by the presumption and\\nthe complacencies of the imaginary. These are supreme\\nmodels whose imitators deflect and disarm them. Doubtless,\\nboth testify more to a tragic experience of madness appearing in the fifteenth century, than to a critical and moral\\nexperience of Unreason developing in their own epoch.\\nOutside of time, they establish a link with a meaning about\\nto be lost, and whose continuity will no longer survive\\nexcept in darkness, But it is by comparing their work, and\\nwhat it maintains, with the meanings thac develop among\\ntheir contemporaries or imitators, that we may decipher\\nwhat is happening, at the beginning of the seventeenth century, in the literary experience of madness.\\n\\nIn Shakespeare or Cervantes, madness still occupies an\\nextreme place, in that it is beyond appeal. Nothing ever\\nrestores it either to truth or to reason. It leads only to\\nlaceration and thence to death. Madness, in its vain words, is\\nnot vanity; the void that fills it is a “disease beyond my\\npractice,” as the doctor says about Lady Macbeth; it is\\nalready the plenitude of death; a madness that has no need\\nof a physician, but only of divine mercy. The sweet joy\\nOphelia finally regains reconciles her with no happiness,\\nher mad song is as close to the essential as the “cry of\\nwomen” that announces through the corridors of Macbeth’s castle that “the Queen is dead.” Certainly Don\\nQuixote’s death occurs in a peaceful landscape, which at\\nthe last moment has rejoined reason and truth. Suddenly\\nthe Knight’s madness has grown conscious of itself, and in\\nhis own eyes trickles out in nonsense. But is this sudden\\nwisdom of his folly anything but “a new madness that had\\n\\n(37)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\njest come into his head”? The equivocation is endlessly\\nreversible and cannot be resolved, ultimately, except by\\ndeath itself, Madness dissipated can be only the same thing\\nas the imminence of the end; “and even one of the signs by\\nwhich they realized that the sick man was dying, was that\\nhe had returned so easily from madness to reason.” But\\ndeath itself does not bring peace; madness will still triumph\\n—a truth mockingly eternal, beyond the end of a life\\nwhich yet had been delivered from madness by this very\\nend. Ironically, Don Quixote’s insane life pursues and immortalizes him only by his insanity; madness is still the\\nimperishable life of death: “Here lies the famous hidalgo\\nwho carried valor to such lengths that it was said death\\ncould not triumph over life by his demise.”\\n\\nBut very soon, madness leaves these ultimate regions\\nwhere Cervantes and Shakespeare had situated it; and in the\\nliterature of the early seventeenth century it occupies, by\\npreference, a median place; it thus constitutes the knot\\nmore than the denouement, the peripity rather than the\\nfinal release. Displaced in the economy of narrative\\nand dramatic structures, it authorizes the manifestation of\\ntruth and the return of reason.\\n\\nThus madness is no longer considered in its tragic reality,\\nin the absolute laceration that gives it access to the other\\nworld; but only in the irony of its illusions. It is not a real\\npunishment, but only the image of punishment, thus a pretense; it can be linked only to the appearance of a crime or\\nto the illusion of a death. Though Ariste, in Tristan |’Hermite’s La Folie du sage, goes mad at the news of his daughter’s death, the fact is that she is not really dead; when\\nEraste, in Mélite, sees himself pursued by the Eumenides\\nand dragged before Minos, it is for a double crime which\\nhe might have committed, which he might have wanted to\\ncommit, but which in fact has not occasioned any real\\ndeath. Madness is deprived of its dramatic seriousness; it is\\n\\n(32)\\n\\x0c “Stultifera Navis”\\n\\npunishment or despair only in the dimension of error. Its\\ndramatic function exists only insofar as we are concerned\\nwith a false drama; a chimerical form in which only supposed faults, illusory murders, ephemeral disappearances\\nare involved.\\n\\nYet this absence of seriousness does not keep madness\\nfrom being essential—even more essential than it had been,\\nfor if it brings illusion to its climax, it is from this point that\\nillusion is undone. In the madness in which his error has\\nenveloped him, the character involuntarily begins to unravel the web. Accusing himself, he speaks the truth in spite\\nof himself. In Mélite, for example, all the stratagems the\\nhero has accumulated to deceive others are turned against\\nhimself, and he becomes their first victim, believing that he\\nis guilty of the deaths of his rival and his mistress. But in his\\ndelirium, he blames himself for having invented a whole\\nseries of love letters; the truth comes to light, in and\\nthrough madness, which, provoked by the illusion of a denouement, actually resolves the real imbroglio of which it is\\nboth cause and effect. To put it another way, madness is\\nthe false. punishment of a false solution, but by its own\\nvirtue it brings to light the real problem, which can then be\\ntruly resolved. It conceals beneath error the secret enterprise of truth. It is this function of madness, both ambiguous and central, that the author of L’Ospital des fous employs when he portrays a pair of lovers who, to escape\\ntheir pursuers, pretend to be mad and hide among madmen;\\nin a fit of simulated dementia, the girl, who is dressed as a\\nboy, pretends to believe she is a girl—which she really is—\\nthus uttering, by the reciprocal neutralization of these two\\npretenses, the truth which in the end will triumph.\\n\\nMadness is the purest, most total form of qui pro quo; it\\ntakes the false for the true, death for life, man for woman,\\nthe beloved for the Erinnys and the victim for Minos. But\\nit is also the most rigorously necessary form of the qui pro\\n\\n(33)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nManness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nquo in the dramatic economy, for it needs no external element to reach a true resolution. It has merely to carry its\\nillusion to the point of truth. Thus it is, at the very heart of\\nthe structure, in its mechanical center, both a feigned conclusion, pregnant with a secret “starting over,” and the first\\nstep toward what will tum out to be the reconciliation\\nwith reason and truth. It marks the point toward which\\nconverge, apparently, the tragic destinies of the characters,\\nand from which, in reality, emerge the lines leading to happiness regained. In madness equilibrium is established, but it\\nmasks that equilibrium beneath the cloud of illusion, beneath feigned disorder; the rigor of the architecture is concealed beneath the cunning arrangement of these disordered\\nviolences. The sudden bursts of life, the random gestures\\nand words, the wind of madness that suddenly breaks lines,\\nshatters attitudes, rumples draperies—while the strings are\\nmerely being pulled tighter—this is the very type of baroque trompe-l\\'ceil. Madness is the great trompe-foeil in\\nthe tragicomic structures of preclassical literature.\\n\\nThis was understood by Georges de Scudéry, who made\\nhis Comédie des comédiens a theater of theater, situating his\\nplay, from the start, in the interacting illusions of madness.\\nOne group of actors takes the part of spectators, another\\nthat of actors, The former must pretend to take the decor\\nfor reality, the play for life, while in realiry these actors are\\nperforming in a real decor; on the other hand, the latter\\nmust pretend to play the part of actors, while in fact, quite\\nsimply, they are actors acting. A double impersonation in\\nwhich each element is doubled, thus forming that renewed exchange of the real and the illusory which is itself\\nthe dramatic meaning of madness. “I do not know,” Mondory says in the prologue to Scudéry’s play, “what extravagance has today come over my companions, but it is\\nso great that I am forced to believe that some spell has\\nrobbed them of their reason, and the worst of it is that they\\n\\n(34)\\n\\x0c  \\n\\nVINTAGE BOOKS EDITION, NOVEMBER 1983\\n\\nCopyright © 1965 by Random House, Inc.\\n\\nAll rights reserved under International and Pan-American Copyright\\nConventions.

Which is,\\nin the strict sense, madness.\\n\\nThe classical experience of madness is born. The great\\nthreat that dawned on the horizon of the fifteenth century\\nsubsides, the disturbing powers that inhabit Bosch’s painting have lost their violence. Forms remain, now transparent\\nand docile, forming a cortége, the inevitable procession of\\nreason. Madness has ceased to be—at the limits of the\\nworld, of man and death—an eschatological figure; the\\ndarkness has dispersed on which the eyes of madness were\\nfixed and out of which the forms of the impossible were\\nborn. Oblivion falls upon the world navigated by the free\\nslaves of the Ship of Fools. Madness will no longer proceed\\nfrom a point within the world to a point beyond, on its\\nstrange voyage; it will never again be that fugitive and\\nabsolute limit. Behold it moored now, made fast among\\nthings and men. Retained and maintained. No longer a ship\\nbut a hospital.\\n\\nScarcely a century after the career of the mad ships, we\\nnote the appearance of the theme of the “Hospital of Madmen,” the “Madhouse.” Here every empty head, fixed and\\nclassified according to the true reason of men, utters contradiction and irony, the double language of Wisdom:\\n“. « . the Hospital of incurable Madmen, where are recited\\nfrom end to end all the follies and fevers of the mind, by\\nmen as well as women, 2 task no less useful than enjoyable,\\nand necessary for the acquisition of true wisdom.” ” Here\\neach form of madness finds its proper place, its distinguishing mark, and its tutelary divinity: frenzied and ranting\\n\\n(35)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nmadness, symbolized by a fool astride a chair, struggles beneath Minerva’s gaze; the somber melancholics that roam\\nthe countryside, solitary and avid wolves, have as their god\\nJupiter, patron of animal metamorphoses; then come the\\n“mad drunkards,” the “madmen deprived of memory and\\nunderstanding,” the “madmen benumbed and half-dead,”\\nthe “madmen of giddy and empty heads”... All this\\nworld of disorder, in perfect order, pronounces, each in his\\ntorn, the Praise of Reason. Already, in this “Hospital,”\\nconfinement has succeeded embarkation.\\n\\nTamed, madness preserves all the appearances of its\\nreign. It now takes part in the measures of reason and in the\\nlabor of truth. It plays on the surface of things and in the\\nglitter of daylight, over all the workings of appearances,\\nover the ambiguity of reality and illusion, over all that indeterminate web, ever rewoven and broken, which both\\nunites and separates truth and appearance. It hides and\\nmanifests, it utters truth and falsehood, it is light and\\nshadow. It shimmers, 2 central and indulgenc figure, already precarious in this baroque age.\\n\\nLet us not be surprised to come upon it so often in the\\nfictions of the novel and the theater.

Men argue passionately for or against\\nNicolas Joubert, better known by the name of Angoulevent, who declares himself Prince of Fools, a title disputed\\nby Valenti le Comte and Jacques Resneau: there follow\\npamphlets, a trial, arguments; his lawyer declares and certifies him to be “an empty head, a gutted gourd, lacking in\\ncommon sense; a cane, a broken brain, that has neither\\nspring nor whole wheel in his head.” Bluet d’ Arbéres, who\\ncalls himself Comte de Permission, is a protégé of the Créquis, the Lesdiguiéres, the Bouillons, the Nemours; in 1602\\nhe publishes—-or someone publishes for him—his works,\\nin which he warns the reader that “he does not know how\\nto read or write, and has never learned,” but that he is\\nanimated “by the inspiration of God and the Angels.”\\nPierre Dupuis, whom Régnier mentions in his sixth satire,\\nis, according to Brascambille, “an archfool in a long robe”;\\nhe himself in his “Remontrance sur le réveil de Maitre\\nGuillaume” states that he has “a mind elevated as far as the\\nantechamber of the third degree of the moon.” And many\\nother characters present in Régnier’s fourteenth satire.\\n\\nThis world of the early seventeenth century is strangely\\nhospitable, in all senses, to madness. Madness is here, at the\\nheart of things and of men, an ironic sign that misplaces the\\nguideposts berween the real and the chimerical, barely retaining the memory of the great tragic threats—a life more\\ndisturbed than disturbing, an absurd agitation in society,\\nthe mobility of reason.\\n\\nBut new requirements are being generated:\\n\\nA hundred and a hundred times have I taken up my lantern,\\nSeeking, at high noon . . .17\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nI]\\n\\nan\\n\\nHe\\n\\nTHE GREAT\\nCONFINEMENT\\n\\nCompelle intrare.\\n\\nBy a strange act of force, the classical age was to reduce to\\nsilence the madness whose voices the Renaissance had just\\nliberated, but whose violence it had already tamed.\\n\\nIc is common knowledge that the seventeenth century\\ncreated enormous houses of confinement; it is less commonly known that more than one out of every hundred\\ninhabitants of the city of Paris found themselves confined\\nthere, within several months. It is common knowledge that\\nabsolute power made use of lettres de cachet and arbitrary\\nmeasures of imprisonment; what is less familiar is the judicial conscience that could inspire such practices. Since\\nPinel, Tuke, Wagnitz, we know that madmen were subjected to the regime of this confinement for a century and\\na half, and that they would one day be discovered in the\\n\\n(38)\\n\\x0c The Great Confinement\\n\\nwards of the Hépital Général, in the cells of prisons; they\\nwould be found mingled with the population of the workhouses or Zuchthdusern. But it has rarely been made clear\\nwhat their status was there, what the meaning was of this\\nproximity which seemed to assign the same homeland to the\\npoor, to the unemployed, to prisoners, and to the insane. It\\nis within the walls of confinement that Pinel and nineteenthcentury psychiatry would come upon madmen; it is there\\n~let us remember—that they would leave them, not without boasting of having “delivered” them. From the middle\\nof the seventeenth century, madness was linked with this\\ncountry of confinement, and with the act which designated\\nconfinement as its natural abode.\\n\\nA date can serve as a landmark: 1656, the decree that\\nfounded, in Paris, the Hépital Général. At first glance, this\\nis merely a reform—little more than an administrative reorganization. Several already existing establishments are\\ngrouped under a single administration: the Salpétriére, rebuilt under the preceding reign to house an arsenal; Bicétre,\\nwhich Louis XIII had wanted to give to the Commandery\\nof Saint Louis as a rest home for military invalids; “the\\nHouse and the Hospital of La Pitié, the larger as well as the\\nsmaller, those of Le Refuge, situated in the Faubourg SaintVictor, the House and Hospital of Scipion, the House of\\nLa Savonnerie, with all the lands, places, gardens, houses,\\nand buildings thereto appertaining.” All were now assigned to the poor of Paris “of both sexes, of all ages and\\nfrom all localities, of whatever breeding and birth, in whatever state they may be, able-bodied or invalid, sick or convalescent, curable or incurable.” These establishments had\\nto accept, lodge, and feed those who presented themselves or\\nthose sent by royal or judicial authority; it was also necessary to assure the subsistence, the appearance, and the general order of those who could not find room, but who\\nmight or who deserved to be there. This responsibility was\\n\\n(39)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavbness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nentrusted to directors appointed for life, who exercised\\ntheir powers, not only in the buildings of the Hépital but\\nthroughout the city of Paris, over all those who came under their jurisdiction: “They have all power of authority,\\nof direction, of administration, of commerce, of police, of\\njurisdiction, of correction and punishment over all rhe poor\\nof Paris, both within and without the Hépital Général.”\\nThe directors also appointed a doctor at a salary of one\\nthousand livres a year; he was to reside at La Pitié, but had\\nto visit each of the houses of the Hépital twice a week.\\n\\nFrom the very start, one thing is clear: the Hdpital Général is not a medical establishment. It is rather a sort of\\nsemijudicial structure, an administrative entity which,\\nalong with the already constituted powers, and outside of\\nthe courts, decides, judges, and executes. “The directors\\nhaving for these purposes stakes, irons, prisons, and dungeons in the said Hopital Général and the places thereto\\nappertaining so much as they deem necessary, no appeal\\nwill be accepted from the regulations they establish within\\nthe said hospital; and as for such regulations as intervene\\nfrom without, they will be executed according to their\\nform and tenor, notwithstanding opposition or whatsoever\\nappeal made or to be made, and without prejudice to these,\\nand for which, notwithstanding all defense or suits for justice, no distinction will be made.”? A quasi-absolute sovereignty, jurisdiction without appeal, a writ of execution\\nagainst which nothing can prevail—the Hépital Général is\\na strange power that the King establishes between the police and the courts, at the limits of the law: a third order of\\nrepression. The insane whom Pinel would find at Bicétre\\n. and at La Salpétriére belonged to this world.\\n\\nIn its functioning, or in its purpose, the Hépital Général\\nhad nothing to do with any medical concept. It was an\\ninstance of order, of the monarchical and bourgeois order\\nbeing organized in France during this period. It was di\\n(40)\\n\\x0c  \\n\\nThe Great Confinement\\n\\nrectly linked with the royal power which placed it under\\nthe authority of the civil government alone; the Grand\\nAlmonry of the Realm, which previously formed an ecclesiastical and spiritual mediation in the politics of assistance,\\nwas abruptly elided. The King decreed: “We choose to be\\nguardian and protector of the said Hépital Général as being\\nof our royal founding and especially as it does not depend\\nin any manner whatsoever upon our Grand Almonry, nor\\nupon any of our high officers, but is to be totally exempt\\nfrom the direction, visitation, and jurisdiction of the officers\\nof the General Reform and others of the Grand Almonry, and from all others to whom we forbid all knowledge and jurisdiction in any fashion or manner whatsoever.” The origin of the project had been parliamentary,\\nand the first ewo administrative heads appointed were the\\nfirst President of the Parlement and the Procurator General. But they were soon supplemented by the Archbishop\\nof Paris, the President of the Court of Assistance, the President of the Court of Exchequer, the Chief of Police, and\\nthe Provost of Merchants. Henceforth the “Grand Buteau” had no more than a deliberative role. The actual administration and the real responsibilities were entrusted to\\nagents recruited by co-optation. These were the true governors, the delegates of royal power and bourgeois fortune\\nto the world of poverty. The Revolution was able to give\\nthem this testimony: “Chosen from the best families of the\\nbourgeoisie, . . . they brought to their administration disinterested views and pure intentions.”*\\n\\nThis structure proper to the monarchical and bourgeois\\norder of France, contemporary with its organization. in\\nabsolutist forms, soon extended its network over the whole\\nof France. An edict of the King, dated June 16, 1676, pre~\\nscribed the establishment of an “bépital général in each city\\nof his kingdom.” Occasionally the measure had been anticipated by the local authorities; the bourgeoisie of Lyons\\n\\n_(4t)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavvess & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nhad already organized in 1612 2 charity establishment that\\nfunctioned in an analogous manner. The Archbishop of\\nTours was proud to declare on July 10, 1676, that his\\n“archepiscopal city has happily foreseen the pious intentions of the King and erected an bépital général called La\\nCharité even before the one in Paris, whose order has\\nserved as a model for all those subsequently established,\\nwithin or outside the kingdom.” The Charité of Tours, in\\nfact, had been founded in 1656, and the King had endowed\\nit with an income of four thousand livres. Over the entire\\nface of France, hépitaux généraux were opened; on the eve\\nof the Revolution, they were to be found in thirty-two\\nprovincial cities.\\n\\nEven if it had been deliberately excluded from the organization of the hédpitaux généraux—by complicity,\\ndoubtless, between royal power and bourgeoisie—the\\nChurch nonetheless did not remain a stranger to the movement. It reformed its own hospital insticutions, redistributed the wealth of its foundations, even created congregations whose purposes were rather analogous to those of the\\nHépital Général. Vincent de Paul reorganized Saint-Lazare, the most important of the former lazar houses of\\nParis; on January 7, 1632, he signed a contract in the name\\nof the Congregationists of the Mission with the “Priory” of\\nSaint-Lazare, which was now to receive “persons detained\\nby order of His Majesty.” The Order of Good Sons\\nopened hospitals of this nature in the north of France. The\\nBrothers of Saint John of God, called into France in 1602,\\nfounded first the Charité of Paris in the Faubourg SaintGermain, then Charenton, into which they moved on May\\n10, 1645. Not far from Paris, they also operated the Charité\\nof Senlis, which opened on October 27, 1670. Some years\\nbefore, the Duchess of Bouillon had donated them the\\nbuildings and benefices of La Maladrerie, founded in the\\nfourteenth century by Thibaut de Champagne, at Chateau\\n(42)\\n\\x0c     \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nThe Great Confinement\\n\\nThierry. They administered also the Charités of Saint-Yon,\\nPontorson, Cadillac, and Romans. In 1699, the Lazarists\\nfounded in Marseilles the establishment that was to become\\nthe H6pital Saint-Pierre. Then, in the eighteenth century,\\ncame Armentiéres (1712), Maréville (1714), the Good\\nSavior of Caen (1735); Saint-Meins of Rennes opened\\nshortly before the Revolution (1780).\\n\\nThe phenomenon has European dimensions. The constitution of an absolute monarchy and the intense Catholic\\nrenaissance during the Counter-Reformation produced in\\nFrance a very particular character of simultaneous competition and complicity berween the government and the\\nChurch, Elsewhere it assumed quite different forms; but its\\nlocalization in time was just as precise. The great hospitals,\\nhouses of confinement, establishments of religion and public order, of assistance and punishment, of governmental\\ncharity and welfare measures, are a phenomenon of the\\nclassical period: as universal as itself and almost contemporary with its birth. In German-speaking countries, it was\\nmarked by the creation of houses of correction, the Zuchtbausern; the first antedates the French houses of ‘confinement (except for the Charité of Lyons); it opened in\\nHamburg around 1620. The others were founded in the\\nsecond half of the century: Basel (1667), Breslau (1668),\\nFrankfort (1684), Spandau (1684), Kénigsberg (169r).\\nThey continued to multiply in the eighteenth century;\\nLeipzig first in 1701, then Halle and Cassel in 1717 and\\n1720, later Brieg and Osnabriick (1756), and finally Torgau in 1777.\\n\\nIn England the origins of confinement are more remote.\\nAn act of 1575 covering both “the punishment of vagabonds and the relief of the poor” prescribed the construction of houses of correction, to number at lease one per\\ncounty. Their upkeep was to be assured by a tax, but the\\npublic was encouraged to make voluntary donations. It ap\\n(43)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\npears, however, that in this form the measure was scarcely\\never applied, since, some years later, it was decided to authorize private enterprise: it was no longer necessary to\\nobtain an official permit to open a hospital or a house of\\ncorrection; anyone who pleased might do so. At the beginning of the seventeenth century, a general reorganization: a\\nfine of five pounds was imposed on any justice of the peace\\nwho had not established one in the area of his jurisdiction;\\nthe houses were to install trades, workshops, and factories\\n(milling, spinning, weaving) to aid in their upkeep and assure their inmates of work; a judge was to decide who was\\nqualified to be sent there. The development of these “bridewells” was not too considerable; often they were gradually\\nabsorbed by the prisons to which they were attached; the\\npractice never spread as far as Scotland. On the other hand,\\nthe workhouses were destined to greater success. They\\ndate from the second half of the seventeenth century. An\\nact of 1670 defined their status, appointed officers of justice\\nto oversee the collection of taxes and the administration of\\nsums that would permit their functioning, and entrusted\\nthe supreme control of their administration to a justice of\\nthe peace, In 1697 several parishes of Bristol united to form\\nthe first workhouse in England, and to designate the corporation that would administer it, Another was established ac\\nWorcester in 1703, a third the same year at Dublin; then at\\nPlymouth, Norwich, Hull, and Exeter. By the end of the\\neighteenth century, there were 126 of them. The Gilbert\\nAct of 1792 gives the parishes facilities to create new ones;\\nat the same time, the control and authority of the justice of\\nthe peace is reinforced; to keep the workhouses from becoming hospitals, it is recommended that all contagious invalids be turned away.\\n\\nIn several years, an entire network had spread across Exrope. John Howard, at the end of the eighteenth century,\\nundertook to investigate it; in England, Holland, Germany,\\n\\n(44)\\n\\x0c INTRODUCTION\\n\\nMicuet Foucavutr has achieved something truly creative\\nin this book on the history of madness during the so-called\\nclassical age: the end of the sixteenth and the seventeenth\\nand eighteenth centuries. Rather than to review historically the concept of madness, the author has chosen to recreate, mostly from original documents, mental illness,\\nfolly, and unreason as they must have existed in their time,\\nplace, and proper social perspective. In a sense, he has tried\\nto re-create the negative part of the concept, that which\\nhas disappeared under the retroactive influence of presentday ideas and the passage of time. Too many historical\\nbooks about psychic disorders look at the past in the light\\nof the present; they single out only what has positive and\\ndirect relevance to present-day psychiatry. This book belongs to the few which demonstrate how skillful, sensitive\\nscholarship uses history to enrich, deepen, and reveal\\nnew avenues for thought and investigation.\\n\\nNo oversimplifications, no black-and-white statements,\\nno sweeping generalizations are ever allowed in this book;\\nfolly is brought back to life as a complex social phenomenon, part and parcel of the human condition. Most of the\\ntime, for the sake of clarity, we examine madness through\\none of its facets; as M. Foucault animates one facet of the\\nproblem after the other, he always keeps them related to\\neach other. The end of the Middle Ages emphasized the\\ncomic, bur just as often the tragic aspect of madness, as in\\nTristan and Iseult, for example, The Renaissance, with\\n\\n(v)\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nThe Great Confinement\\n\\nFrance, Italy, Spain, he made pilgrimages to all the chief\\ncenters of confinement—“hospitals, prisons, jails”—and his\\nphilanthropy was outraged by the fact that the same walls\\ncould contain those condemned by common law, young\\nmen who disturbed their families’ peace or who squandered\\ntheir goods, people without profession, and the insane.\\nProof that even at this period, a certain meaning had been\\nlost: that which had se hastily, so spontaneously summoned\\ninto being all over Europe the category of classical order we\\ncall confinement. In a hundred and fifty years, confinement\\nhad become the abusive amalgam of heterogeneous elements. Yet at its origin, there must have existed a unity\\nwhich justified its urgency; between these diverse forms\\nand the classical period that called them into being, there\\nmust have been a principle of cohesion we cannot evade\\nunder the scandal of pre-Revolutionary sensibility. What,\\nthen, was the reality represented by this entire population\\nwhich almost overnight found itself shut up, excluded\\nmore severely than the lepers? We must not forget that 4\\nfew years after its foundation, the Hépital Général of Paris\\nalone contained six thousand persons, or around one per\\ncent of the population. There must have. formed, silently\\nand doubtless over the course of many years, a social sensibility, common to European culture, that suddenly began\\nto manifest itself in the second half of the seventeenth century; it was this sensibility that suddenly isolated the cate~\\ngory destined to populate the places of confinement. To\\ninhabit the reaches Jong since abandoned by the lepers,\\nthey chose a group that to our eyes is strangely mixed and\\nconfused. But what is for us merely an undifferentiated\\nsensibility must have been, for those living in the classical\\nage, a clearly articulated perception. It is this mode of perception which we must investigate in order to discover the\\nform of sensibiliry to madness in an epoch we are accustomed to define by the privileges of Reason. The act\\n\\n(45)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavwness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nwhich, by tracing the locus of confinement, conferred\\nupon it its power of segregation and provided a new\\nhomeland for madness, though it may be coherent and\\nconcerted, is not simple. It organizes into a complex unity 2\\nnew sensibility to poverty and to the duties of assistance,\\nnew forms of reaction to the economic problems of unemployment and idleness, a new ethic of work, and also the\\ndream of a city where moral obligation was joined to civil\\nlaw, within the authoritarian forms of constraint, Obscurely, these themes are present during the construction of\\nthe cities of confinement and their organization. They give\\na meaning to this ritual, and explain in part the mode in\\nwhich madness was perceived, and experienced, by the\\nclassical age.\\n\\nConfinement, that massive phenomenen, the signs of\\nwhich are found all across eighteenth-century Europe, is a\\n“police” matter. Police, in the precise sense that the classical\\nepoch gave to it—that is, the totality of measures which\\nmake work possible and necessary for all those who could\\nnot live without it; the question Voltaire would soon\\nformulate, Colbert’s contemporaries had already asked:\\n“Since you have established yourselves as a people, have\\nyou not yet discovered the secret of forcing all the rich to\\nmake all the poor work? Are you still ignorant of the first\\nprinciples of the police?”\\n\\nBefore having the medical meaning we give it, or that at\\nleast we like to suppose it has, confinement was required by\\nsomething quite different from any concern with curing\\nthe sick. What made it necessary was an imperative of labor. Our philanthropy prefers to recognize the signs of a\\nbenevolence toward sickness where there is only a condemnation of idleness.\\n\\nLet us return to the first moments of the “Confinement,”\\nand to that royal edict of April 27, 1656, that led to the\\n\\n(46)\\n\\x0c The Great Confinement\\n\\ncreation of the Hépital Général. From the beginning, the\\ninstitution set itself the task of preventing “mendicancy\\nand idleness as the source of all disorders.” In fact, this was\\nthe last of the great measures that had been taken since the\\nRenaissance to put an end to unemployment or at least to\\nbegging.‘ In 1532, the Parlement of Paris decided to arrest\\nbeggars and force them to work in the sewers of the city,\\nchained in pairs. The situation soon reached critical proportions: on March 23, 1534, the order was given “to poor\\nscholars and indigents” to leave the city, while it was forbidden “henceforth to sing hymns before images in the\\nstreets.” The wars of religion muluplied this suspect\\ncrowd, which included peasants driven from their farms,\\ndisbanded soldiers or deserters, unemployed workers, impoverished students, and the sick. When Henri IV began\\nthe siege of Paris, the city, which had less than 100,000\\ninhabitants, contained more than 30,000 beggars. An economic revival began early in the seventeenth century; it\\nwas decided to reabsorb by force the unemployed who\\nhad not regained a place in society; a decree of the Parlement dated 1606 ordered the beggars of Paris to be\\nwhipped in the public square, branded on the shoulder,\\nshorn, and then driven from the city; to keep them from\\nreturning, an ordinance of 1607 established companies of\\narchers at all the city gates to forbid entry to indigents.\\nWhen the effects of the economic renaissance disappeared\\nwith the Thirty Years’ War, the problems of mendicancy\\nand idleness reappeared; until the middle of the century,\\nthe regular increase of taxes hindered manufactures and\\naugmented unemployment, This was the period of uprisings in Paris (1621), in Lyons (1652), in Rouen (1639).\\nAt the same time, the world of labor was disorganized by\\nthe appearance of new economic structures; as the large\\nmanufactories developed, the guilds lost their powers and\\ntheir rights, the “General Regulations” prohibited all as\\n(47)\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nsemblies of workers, all leagues, all “‘associations.” In many\\nprofessions, however, the guilds were reconstituted. They\\nwere prosecuted, but it seems that the Parlements showed a\\ncertain apathy; the Parlement of Normandy disclaimed all\\ncompetence to judge the rioters of Rouen. This is doubtless why the Church intervened and accused the workers’\\nsecret gatherings of sorcery. A decree of the Sorbonne, in\\n1655, proclaimed “guilty of sacrilege and mortal sin” all\\nthose who were found in such bad company.\\n\\nIn this silent conflict that opposed the severity of the\\nChurch to the indulgence of the Parlements, the creation of\\nthe Hépital was certainly, at least in the beginning, a victory for the Parlement, It was, in any case, a new solution.\\nFor the first time, purely negative measures of exclusion\\nwere replaced by a measure of confinement, the unemployed person was no longer driven away or punished; he\\nwas taken in charge, at the expense of the nation but at the\\ncost of his individual liberty. Between him and society, an\\nimplicit system of obligation was established: he had the\\nright to be fed, bur he must accept the physical and moral\\nconstraint of confinement.\\n\\nIt is this entire, rather undifferentiated mass at which the\\nedict of 1657 is aimed; a population without resources,\\nwithout social moorings, a class rejected or rendered mobile\\nby new economic developments. Less than two weeks after\\nir was signed, the edict was read and proclaimed in the\\nstreets. Paragraph 9: “We expressly prohibit and forbid all\\npersons of either sex, of any locality and of any age, of\\nwhatever breeding and birth, and in whatever condition\\nthey may be, able-bodied or invalid, sick or convalescent,\\ncurable or incurable, to beg in the city and suburbs of\\nParis, neither in the churches, nor at the doors of such, nor\\nat the doors of houses nor in the streets, nor anywhere else\\nin public, nor in secret, by day or night... under pain of\\nbeing whipped for the first offense, and for the second\\n\\n(48)\\n\\x0c The Great Confinement\\n\\ncondemned to the galleys if men and boys, banished if\\nwomen and girls.” The year efter-Sunday, May 13, 1657\\n—a high mass in honor of the Holy Ghost was sung at the\\nChurch of Saint-Louis de la Pitié, and on the morning of\\nMonday the fourteenth, the militia, which was to become,\\nin the mythology of popular terror, “the archers of the\\nHpital,” began to hunt down beggars and herd them into\\nthe different buildings of the Hépital. Four years later, La\\nSalpétriére housed 1,460 women and small children; at La\\nPitié there were 98 boys, 897 girls between seven and\\nseventeen, and 9; women; at Bicétre, 1,615 adult men; at\\nLa Savonnerie, 305 boys between eight and thirteen; finally, Scipion lodged 30 pregnant women, nursing women,\\nand very young children, Initially, married people, even in\\nneed, were not admitted; the administration was instructed\\nto feed them at home; but soon, thanks to a grant from\\nMazarin, it was possible to lodge them at La Salpéeri¢re. In\\nall, between five and six thousand persons.\\n\\nThroughout Europe, confinement had the same meaning, at least if we consider its origin. Ir constituted one of\\nthe answers the seventeenth century gave to an economic\\ncrisis that affected the entire Western world: reduction of\\nwages, unemployment, scarcity of coin—the coincidence\\nof these phenomena probably being due to a crisis in the\\nSpanish economy. Even England, of all the countries of\\nWestern Europe the least dependent on the system, had to\\nsolve the same problems. Despite all the measures taken to\\navoid unemployment and the reduction of wages, poverty\\ncontinued to spread in the nation. In 1622 appeared a\\npamphlet, Grievous Groan for the Poor, attributed to\\nThomas Dekker, which, emphasizing the danger, condemns\\nthe general negligence: “Though the number of the poor\\ndo daily increase, all things yet worketh for the worst in\\ntheir behalf; . . . many of these parishes curneth forth\\ntheir poor, yea, and their lusty labourers that will not\\n\\n(49)\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nwork . . . to beg, filch, and steal for their maintenance, so\\nthat the country is pitifully pestered with them.” It was\\nfeared that they would overrun the country, and since they\\ncould not, as on the Continent, cross the border into another nation, it was proposed that they be “banished and\\nconveyed to the New-found Land, the East and West Indies.” In 1630, the King established a commission to assure\\nthe rigorous observance of the Poor Laws. That same year,\\nit published a series of “orders and directions”; it recommended prosecuting beggars and vagabonds, as well as “all\\nthose who live in idleness and will not work for reasonable\\nwages or who spend what they have in taverns.” They\\nmust be punished according to Jaw and placed in houses of\\ncorrection; as for those with wives and children, investigation must be made as to whether they were married and\\ntheir children baptized, “for these people live like savages\\nwithout being married, nor buried, nor baptized; and it is\\nthis licentious liberty which causes so many to rejoice in\\nvagabondage.” Despite the recovery that began in England\\nin the middle of the century, the problem was still unsolved\\nin Cromwell’s time, for the Lord Mayor complains of “this\\nvermin that troops about the city, disturbing public order,\\nassaulting carriages, demanding alms with loud cries at the\\ndoors of churches and private houses.”\\n\\nFor a long time, the house of correction or the premises\\nof the Hépital Général would serve to contain the unemployed, the idle, and vagabonds. Each time a crisis occurred\\nand the number of the poor sharply increased, the houses\\nof confinement regained, at least for a time, their initial\\neconomic significance. In the middle of the eighteenth century, there was another great crisis: 12,000 begging workers at Roven and as many at Tours; at Lyons the manufactories closed. The Count d’Argenson, “who commands the\\ndepartment of Paris and the marshalseas,” gave orders “to\\narrest all the beggars of the kingdom; the marshalseas will\\n\\n(so)\\n\\x0c The Great Confinement\\n\\nperform this task in the countryside, while the same thing\\nis done in Paris, whither they are sure not to return, being\\nentrapped on all sides.”\\n\\nBut outside of the periods of crisis, confinement acquired\\nanother meaning. Its repressive function was combined\\nwith a new use. It was no longer merely a question of\\nconfining those out of work, but of giving work to those\\nwho had been confined and thus making them contribute to\\nthe prosperity of all. The alternation is clear: cheap manpower in the periods of full employment and high salaries;\\nand in periods of unemployment, reabsorption of the idle\\nand social protection against agitation and uprisings. Let us\\nnot forget that the firsr houses of confinement appear in\\nEngland in the most industrialized parts of the country:\\nWorcester, Norwich, Bristol; that the first bdpital général\\nwas opened in Lyons, forty years before that of Paris, that\\nHamburg was the first German city to have its Zuchthaus,\\nin 1620. Its regulations, published in 1622, were quite precise. The internees must all work. Exact record was kept of\\nthe value of their work, and they were paid a fourth of it.\\nFor work was not only an occupation; it must be productive. The eight directors of the house established a general\\nplan. The Werkmeister assigned a task to each, and ascertained at the end of the week that it had been accomplished. The rule of work would remain in effect until the\\nend of the eighteenth century, since John Howard could\\nstill attest that they were “knitting and spinning; weaving\\nstockings, linen, hair, and wool—and rasping logwood and\\nhartshorn. The quota of a robust man who shreds such\\nwood is forty-five pounds a day. Some men and horses\\nlabour at a fulling-mill. A blacksmith works there without\\ncease.” Each house of confinement in Germany had its\\nspecialty: spinning was paramount in Bremen, Brunswick,\\nMunich, Breslau, Berlin; weaving in Hanover. The men\\nshredded wood in Bremen and Hamburg. In Nuremberg\\n\\n(57)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Mavoness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nthey polished optical glass; at Mainz the principal labor was\\nthe milling of flour.\\n\\nThe first houses of correction were opened in England\\nduring a full economic recession. The act of 1610 recommended only joining certain mills and weaving and carding\\nshops to all houses of correction in order to occupy the\\npensioners. But what had been a moral requirement became\\nan economic tactic when commerce and industry recovered\\nafter 1651, the economic situation having been re-established by the Navigation Act and the lowering of the discount rate. All able-bodied manpower was to be used to the\\nbest advantage, that is, as cheaply as possible. When John\\nCarey established his workhouse project in Bristol, he\\nranked the need for work first: “The poor of both sexes\\n\\n. may be employed in beating hemp, dressing and\\nspinning flax, or in carding wool and cotton.” At Worcester, they manufactured clothes and stuffs; a workshop\\nfor children was established. All of which did not always\\nproceed without difficulties. It was suggested that the\\nworkhouses might enter the local industries and markets,\\non the principle perhaps that such cheap production would\\nhave a regulatory effect on the sale price. But the manufactories protested. Daniel Defoe noticed that by the effect of\\nthe too easy competition of the workhouses, poverty was\\ncreated in one area on the pretext of suppressing it in an~\\nother; “it is giving to one what you take away from another; putting a vagabond in an honest man’s employment,\\nand putting diligence on the tenters to find out some other\\nwork to maintain his family.” Faced with this danger of\\ncompetition, the authorities let the work gradually disappear. The pensioners could no longer earn even enough\\nto pay for their upkeep; at times it was necessary to put\\nthem in prison so that they might at least have free bread.\\nAs for the bridewells, as Howard attested, there were few\\n“Sn which any work is done, or can be done. The prisoners\\n\\n(52)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nThe Great Confinement\\n\\nhave neither tools, nor materials of any kind: but spend\\ntheir time in sloth, profaneness and debauchery.”\\n\\nWhen the Hépital Général was created in Paris, it was\\nintended above all to suppress beggary, rather than to provide an occupation for the internees. It seems, however,\\nthat Colbert, like his English contemporaries, regarded\\nassistance through work as both a remedy to unemployment\\nand a stimulus to the development of manufactories. In any\\ncase, in the provinces the directors were to see that the\\nhouses of charity had a certain economic significance, “All\\nthe poor who are capable of working must, upon work\\ndays, do what is necessary to avoid idleness, which is the\\nmother of all evils, as well as to accustom them to honest\\ntoil and also to earning some part of their sustenance.”\\n\\nSometimes there were even arrangements which permitted private entrepreneurs to utilize the manpower of the\\nasylums for their own profit. Ic was stipulated, for example,\\naccording to an agreement made in 1708, that an entrepreneur should furnish the Charité of Tulle with wool,\\nsoap, and coal, and in return the establishment would redeliver the wool carded and spun. The profit was divided\\nbetween the entrepreneur and the hospital. Even in Paris,\\nseveral attempts were made to transform the buildings of\\nthe Hépital Général into factories. If we can believe the\\nauthor of an anonymous mézmoire that appeared in 1790, at\\nLa Pitié “all the varieties of manufacture that could be\\noffered to the capital” were attempted, finally, “in a kind\\nof despair, a manufacture was undertaken of 2 sort of lacing found to be the least costly.” Elsewhere, such efforts\\nwere scarcely more fruitful. Numerous efforts were made\\nat Bicétre; manufacture of thread and rope, mirror polishing, and especially the famous “great well.” An attempt\\n‘was even made, in 1781, to substitute teams of prisoners for\\nthe horses that brought up the water, in relay from five in\\nthe morning to eight at night: “What reason could have\\n\\n(53)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c MADNESS & CIVILIZATION\\n\\ndetermined this strange occupation? Was it that of economy or simply the necessity of busying the prisoners? If\\nthe latter, would it not have been better to occupy them\\nwith work more useful both for them and for the hospital?\\nIf for reasons of economy, we are a long way from finding\\nany.”* During the entire eighteenth century, the economic\\nsignificance Colbert wanted to give the Hépital Général\\ncontinued to recede; that center of forced labor would become a place of privileged idleness. “What is the source of\\nthe disorders at Bicétre?” the men of the Revolution were\\nagain to ask, And they would supply the answer that had\\nalready been given in the seventeenth century: “It is idleness. What is the means of remedying it? Work.”\\n\\nThe classical age used confinement in an equivocal manner, making it play a double role: to reabsorb unemployment, or at least eliminate its most visible social effects, and\\nto control costs when they seemed likely to become too\\nhigh; to act alternately on the manpower market and on\\nthe cost of production. As it turned out, it does not seem\\nthat the houses of confinement were able to play effectively\\nthe double role that was expected of them. If they absorbed\\nthe unemployed, it was mostly to mask their poverty, and\\nto avoid the social or political disadvantages of agitation;\\nbut at the very moment the unemployed were herded into\\nforced-labor shops, unemployment increased in neighboring regions or in similar areas. As for the effect on production costs, it could only be artificial, the market price of\\nsuch products being disproportionate to the cost of manufacture, calculated according to the expenses occasioned by\\nconfinement itself.\\n\\nMeasured by their functional value alone, the creation of\\nthe houses of confinement can be regarded as a failure.\\nTheir disappearance throughout Europe, at the beginning\\nof the nineteenth century, as receiving centers for the in\\n(34)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\nErasmus’s Praise of Folly, demonstrated how fascinating\\nimagination and some of its vagaries were to the thinkers of\\nthat day. The French Revolution, Pinel, and Tuke emphasized political, legal, medical, or religious aspects of madness; and today, our so-called objective medical approach,\\nin spite of the benefits that it has brought to the mentally\\nill, continues to look at only one side of the picture. Folly is\\nso human that it has common roots with poetry and tragedy; it is revealed as much in the insane asylum as in the\\nwritings of a Cervantes or a Shakespeare, or in the deep\\npsychological insights and cries of revolt of a Nietzsche.\\nCorrectly or incorrectly, the author feels that Freud’s\\ndeath instinct also stems from the tragic elements which led\\nmen of all epochs to worship, laugh at, and dread folly\\nsimultaneously, Fascinating as Renaissance men found it—\\nthey painted it, praised it, sang about it—it also heralded\\nfor them death of the body by picturing death of the mind.\\n\\nNothing is more illuminating than to follow with M.\\nFoucault the many threads which are woven in this complex book, whether it speaks of changing symptoms, commitment procedures, or treatment. For example: he sees a\\ndefinite connection between some of the attirudes toward\\nmadness and the disappearance, between 1200 and 1400, of\\nleprosy. In the middle of the twelfth century, France had\\nmore than 2,000 leprosariums, and England and Scotland 220 for a population of a million and a half\\npeople. As leprosy vanished, in part because of segregation,\\na void was created and the moral values attached to the\\nleper had to find another scapegoat. Mental illness and unreason attracted that stigma to themselves, but even this\\nwas neither complete, simple, nor immediate.\\n\\nRenaissance men developed a delightful, yet horrible\\nway of dealing with their mad denizens: they were put on\\na ship and entrusted to mariners because folly, water, and\\nsea, as everyone then “knew,” had an affinity for each\\n\\n(vi)\\n\\x0c The Great Confinement\\n\\ndigent and prisons of poverty, was to sanction their ultimate failure: a transitory and ineffectual remedy, a social\\nprecaution clumsily formulated by a nascent industrialization, And yet, in this very failure, the classical period conducted an irreducible experiment. What appears to us today as a clumsy dialectic of production and prices then\\npossessed its real meaning as a certain ethical consciousness\\nof labor, in which the difficulties of the economic mechanisms lost their urgency in favor of an affirmation of value.\\n\\nIn this first phase of the industrial world, labor did not\\nseem linked to the problems it was to provoke; it was regarded, on the contrary, as a general solution, an infallible\\npanacea, a remedy to all forms of poverty. Labor and poverty were located in a simple opposition, in inverse proportion to each other. As for that power, its special characteristic, of abolishing poverty, labor--according to the classical\\ninterpretation—possessed it not so much by its productive capacity as by a certain force of moral enchantment.\\nLabor’s effectiveness was acknowledged because it was\\nbased on an ethical transcendence. Since the Fall, man had\\naccepted labor as a penance and for its power to work\\nredemption. It was not a law of nature which forced man\\nto work, but the effect of a curse. The earth was innocent\\nof that sterility in which it would slumber if man remained\\nidle: “The land had not sinned, and if it is accursed, it is by\\nthe labor of the fallen man who cultivates it; from it no\\nfruit is won, particularly the most necessary fruit, save by\\nforce and continual labor.”*\\n\\nThe obligation to work was not linked to any confidence\\nin nature; and it was not even through an obscure loyalty\\nthat the land would reward man’s labor. The theme was\\nconstant among Catholic thinkers, as among the Protestants, that labor does not bear its own fruits. Produce and\\nwealth were not found at the term of a dialectic of labor\\nand nature. Here is Calvin’s admonition: “Nor do we be\\n(s5)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Mavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nlieve, according as men will be vigilant and skillful, according as they will have done their duty well, that they can\\nmake their land fertile; it is the benediction of God which\\ngoverns all things.” And this danger of a labor which\\nwould remain sterile if God did not intervene in His infinite mercy is acknowledged in turn by Bossiet: “At each\\nmoment, the hope of the harvest and the unique fruit of all\\nour labors may escape us; we are at the mercy of the inconstant heavens that bring down rain upon the tender ears.”\\nThis precarious labor to which nature is never obliged\\nto respond—save by the special will of God—is nonetheless obligatory in all strictness: not on the level of\\nnatural syntheses, but on the level of moral syntheses. The\\npoor man who, without consenting to “torment” the land,\\nwaits until God comes to his aid, since He has promised to\\nfeed the birds of the sky, would be disobeying the great\\nlaw of Scripture: “Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy\\nGod.” Does not reluctance to work mean “trying beyond\\nmeasure the power of God,” as Calvin says? It is seeking to\\nconstrain the miracle,” whereas the miracle is granted daily\\nto man as the gratuitous reward of his labor. If it is true\\nthat labor is not inscribed among the laws of nature, it is\\nenveloped in the order of the fallen world. This is why\\nidleness is rebellion—the worst form of all, in a sense: it\\nwaits for nature to be generous as in the innocence of\\nEden, and seeks to constrain a Goodness to which man\\ncannot lay claim since Adam. Pride was the sin of man\\nbefore the Fall; but the sin of idleness is the supreme pride\\nof man once he has fallen, the absurd pride of poverty. In\\nour world, where the land is no longer fertile except in\\nthistles and weeds, idleness is the fault par excellence. In the\\nMiddle Ages, the great sin, radix malorum omnium, was\\npride, Superbia. According to Johan Huizinga, there was a\\ntime, at the dawn of the Renaissance, when the supreme sin\\nassumed the aspect of Avarice, Dante’s cicca cupidigia. All\\n\\n(56)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c The Great Confinement\\n\\nthe seventeenth-century texts, on the contrary, announced\\nthe infernal triumph of Sloth: it was sloth which Jed the\\nround of the vices and swept them on. Let us not forget\\nthat according to the edict of its creation, the Hépital Général must prevent “mendicancy and idleness as sources of\\nall disorder.” Louis Bourdaloue echoes these condemnations of sloth, the wretched pride of fallen man: “What,\\nthen, is the disorder of an idle life? It is, replies Saint Ambrose, in its true meaning a second rebellion of the creature\\nagainst God.” Labor in the houses of confinement thus assumed its ethical meaning: since sloth had become the\\nabsolute form of rebellion, the idle would be forced to\\nwork, in the endless leisure of a labor without utilicy or\\nprofit.\\n\\nIt was in a certain experience of labor that the indissociably economic and moral demand for confinement was\\nformulated. Between labor and idleness in the classical world\\nran a line of demarcation that replaced the exclusion of\\nleprosy. The asylum was substituted for the lazar house, in\\nthe geography of haunted places as in the landscape of the\\nmoral universe. The old rites of excommunication were revived, but in the world of production and commerce. Ic\\nwas in these places of doomed and despised idleness, in\\nthis space invented by a society which had derived an ethical transcendence from the law of work, that madness\\nwould appear and soon expand until it had annexed them.\\nA day was to come when it could possess these sterile\\nreaches of idleness by a sort of very old and very dim nght\\nof inheritance. The nineteenth century would consent,\\nwould even insist that to the mad and to them alone be\\ntransferred these lands on which, a hundred and fifty years’\\nbefore, men had sought to pen the poor, the vagabond, the\\nunemployed.\\n\\nIt is not immaterial that madmen were included in the\\nproscription of idleness. From its origin, they would have\\n\\n(57)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c MavNESS & CIVILIZATION\\n\\ntheir place beside the poor, deserving or not, and the idle,\\nvoluntary or not. Like them, they would be subject to the\\nrules of forced labor. More than once, in fact, they figured\\nin their singular fashion within this uniform constraint. In\\nthe workshops in which they were interned, they distinguished themselves by their inability to work and to follow\\nthe rhythms of collective life. The necessity, discovered in\\nthe eighteenth century, to provide a special regime for the\\ninsane, and the great crisis of confinement that shortly preceded the Revolution, are linked to the experience of mad~ness available in the universal necessity of labor. Men did\\nnot wait until the seventeenth century to “shut up” the\\nmad, but it was in this period that they began to “confine”\\nor “intern” them, along with an entire population with\\nwhom their kinship was recognized. Until the Renaissance,\\nthe sensibility to madness was linked to the presence of\\nimaginary transcendences. In the classical age, for the first\\ntime, madness was perceived through a condemnation of\\nidleness and in a social immanence guaranteed by the community of labor. This community acquired an ethical\\npower of segregation, which permitted it to eject, as into\\nanother world, all forms of social uselessness. It was in this\\nother world, encircled by the sacred powers of labor, that\\nmadness would assume the status we now attribute to ic. If\\nthere is, in classical madness, something which refers elsewhere, and to other things, it is no longer because the madman comes from the world of the irrational and bears its\\nstigmata; rather, it is because he crosses the frontiers of\\nbourgeois order of his own accord, and alienates himself\\noutside the sacred limits of its ethic,\\n\\nIn fact, the relation between the practice of confinement\\nand the insistence on work is not defined by economic conditions; far from it. A moral perception sustains and animates it. When the Board of Trade published its report on\\nthe poor in which it proposed the means “to render them\\n\\n(58)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c The Great Confinement\\n\\nuseful to the public,” it was made quite clear that the origin of poverty was neither scarcity of commodities nor unemployment, but “the weakening of discipline and the\\nrelaxation of morals.” The edict of 1657, too, was full of\\nmoral denunciations and strange threats, “The libertinage\\nof beggars has risen to excess because of an unfortunate\\ntolerance of crimes of all sorts, which attract the curse of\\nGod upon the State when they remain unpunished.” This\\n“fibertinage” is not the kind that can be defined in relation\\nto the great law of work, but a moral libertinage: ‘Experience having taught those persons who are employed in\\ncharitable occupations that many among them of either sex\\nlive together without marriage, that many of their children\\nare unbaptized, and that almost all of them live in ignorance\\nof religion, disdaining the sacraments, and continually practicing all sorts of vice.” Hence the Hépital does not have\\nthe appearance of a mere refuge for those whom age, infirmity, or sickness keep from working; it will have not\\nonly the aspect of a forced labor camp, but also that of a\\nmoral institution responsible for punishing, for correcting a\\ncertain moral “abeyance” which does not merit the tribunal\\nof men, but cannot be corrected by the severity of penance\\nalone, The Hépital Général has an ethical status. It is this\\nmoral charge which invests its directors, and they are\\ngranted every judicial apparatus and means of repression:\\n“They have power of authority, of direction, of administration, of commerce, of police, of jurisdiction, of correction and punishment”; and to accomplish this task “stakes,\\nirons, prisons, and dungeons” are put at their disposal.\\n\\nAnd it is in this context that the obligation to work assumes its meaning as both ethical exercise and moral guarantee. It will serve as askesis, as punishment, as symptom of\\na certain disposition of the heart. The prisoner who could\\nand who would work would be released, not so much because he was again useful to society, but because he had\\n\\n(59)\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavwess & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nagain subscribed to the great ethical pact of human existence. In April 1684, a decree created within the Hépital a\\nsection for boys and girls under twenty-five; it specified\\nthat work must occupy the greater part of the day, and\\nmust be accompanied by “the reading of pious books.” But\\nthe ruling defines the purely repressive nature of this work,\\nbeyond any concern for production: “They will be made\\nto work as long and as hard as their strengths and situations\\nwill permit.” It is then, bur only then, that they can be\\ntaught an occupation “fitting their sex and inclination,”\\ninsofar as the measure of their zeal in the first activities\\nmakes it possible to “judge that they desire to reform.”\\nFinally, every fault “will be punished by reduction of\\ngruel, by increase of work, by imprisonment and other\\npunishments customary in the said hospitals, as the direc~\\ntors shall see fit.” Ir is enough to read the “general regula~\\ntions for daily life in the House of Saint-Louis de la Salpétriére” to understand that the very requirement of labor was\\ninstituted as an exercise in moral reform and constraint,\\nwhich reveals, if not the ultimate meaning, at least the essential justification of confinement.\\n\\nAn important phenomenon, this invention of 2 site of\\nconstraint, where morality castigates by means of administrative enforcement. For the first time, institutions of\\nmorality are established in which an astonishing synthesis\\nof moral obligation and civil law is effected, The law of\\nnations will no longer countenance the disorder of hearts. To\\nbe sure, this is not the first time in European culture that\\nmoral error, even in its most private form, has assumed the\\naspect of a transgression against the written or unwritten\\nlaws of the community. But in this great confinement of\\nthe classical age, the essential thing--and the new event—is\\nthat men were confined in cities of pure morality, where\\nthe law that should reign in all hearts was to be applied\\nwithout compromise, without concession, in the rigorous\\n\\n(f0)\\n\\x0c The Great Confinement\\n\\nforms of physical constraint. Morality permitted itself to be\\nadministered like trade or economy.\\n\\nThus we see inscribed in the institutions of absolute\\nmonarchy-~in the very ones that long remained the symbol\\nof its arbitrary power—the great bourgeois, and soon re~\\npublican, idea that virtue, too, is-an affair of state, that\\ndecrees can be published to make it flourish, that an authority can be established to make sure it is respected. The walls\\nof confinement actually enclose the negative of that moral\\ncity of which the bourgeois conscience began to dream in\\nthe seventeenth century; a moral city for those who\\nsought, from the start, to avoid it, a city where right reigns\\nonly by virtue of a force without appeal—a sort of sovereignty of good, in which intimidation alone prevails and the\\nonly recompense of virtue (to this degree its own reward)\\nis to escape punishment. In the shadows of the bourgecis\\ncity is born this strange republic of the good which is imposed by force on all those suspected of belonging to evil.\\nThis is the underside of the bourgeoisie’s great dream and\\ngreat preoccupation in the classical age: the laws of the\\nState and the laws of the heart at last identical. “Let our\\npoliticians leave off their calculations . . . let them learn\\nonce and for alt that everything can be had for money,\\nexcept morals and citizens.”°\\n\\nIs this not the dream that seems to have haunted the\\nfounders of the house of confinement in Hamburg? One of\\nthe directors is to see that “all in the house are properly\\ninstructed as to religious and moral duties... . The\\nschoolmaster must instruct the children in religion, and encourage them, at proper times, to learn and repeat portions\\nof Scripture. He must also teach them reading, writing and\\naccounts, and a decent behaviour to those that visit the\\nhouse. He must take care that they attend divine service,\\nand are orderly at it.”!° In England, the workhouse regulations devote much space to the surveillance of morals and\\n\\n(67)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nto religious education. Thus for the house in Plymouth, 2\\nschoolmaster is to be appointed who will fulfill the triple\\nrequirement of being “pious, sober, and discreet.” Every\\nmorning and evening, at the prescribed hour, it will be his\\ntask to preside at prayers; every Saturday afternoon and on\\nholidays, he will address the inmates, exhorting and instructing them in “the fundamental parts of the Protestant\\nreligion, according to the doctrine of the Church of England.” Hamburg or Plymouth, Zuchthausern and workhouses—throughout Protestant Europe, fortresses of moral\\norder were constructed, in which were taught religion and\\nwhatever was necessary to the peace of the State.\\n\\nIn Catholic countries, the goal is the same but the religious imprint is a little more marked, as the work of Saint\\nVincent de Paul bears witness. “The principal end for\\nwhich such persons have been removed here, out of the\\nstorms of the great world, and introduced into this solitude\\nas pensioners, is entirely to keep them from the slavery of\\nsin, from being eternally damned, and to give them means\\nto rejoice in a perfect contentment in this world and in the\\nnext; they will do all they can to worship, in this world,\\nDivine Providence. . . . Experience convinces us only too\\nunhappily that the source of the misrule triumphant today\\namong the young lies entirely in the lack of instruction and\\nof obedience in spiritual matters, since they much prefer to\\nfollow their evil inclinations than the holy inspiration of\\nGod and the charitable advice of their parents.”\"* Therefore the pensioners must be delivered from a world which,\\nfor their weakness, is only an invitation to sin, must be\\nrecalled to a solitude where they will have as companions\\nonly their “guardian angels” incarnate in the daily presence\\nof their warders: these latter, in fact, “render them the\\nsame good offices that their guardian angels perform for\\nthem invisibly: namely, instruct them, console them, and\\nprocure their salvation.” In the houses of La Chariré, the\\n\\n(62)\\n\\x0c The Great Confinement\\n\\ngreatest attention was paid to this ordering of life and conscience, which throughout the eighteenth century would\\n‘more and more clearly appear as the raison d’étre of confinement. In 1765, new regulations were established for the\\nCharité of Chateau-Thierry; it was made quite clear that\\n“the Prior will visit all the prisoners at least once a week,\\none after the other, and separately, to console them, to\\nexhort them to better conduct, and to assure himself that\\nthey are treated as they should be; the subordinate officer\\nwill do this every day.”\\n\\nAll these prisons of moral order might have borne the\\nmotto which Howard could still read on the one in Mainz:\\n“If wild beasts can be broken to the yoke, it must not be\\ndespaired of correcting the man who has strayed.” For the\\nCatholic Church, as in the Protestant countries, confinement represents, in the form of an authoritarian model, the\\nmyth of social happiness: a police whose order will be entirely transparent to the principles of religion, and a religion whose requirements will be satisfied, without restrictions, by the regulations of the police and the constraints\\nwith which it can be armed. There is, in these institutions,\\nan attempt of a kind to demonstrate that order may be\\nadequate to virtue. In this sense, “confinement” conceals\\nboth a metaphysics of government and a politics of religion; it is sicuated, as an effort of tyrannical synthesis, in\\nthe vast space separating the garden of God and the cities\\nwhich men, driven from paradise, have built with their\\nown hands. The house of confinement in the classical age\\nconstitutes the densest symbol of that “police” which conceived of itself as the civil equivalent of religion for the\\nedification of a perfect city.\\n\\nConfinement was an institutional creation peculiar to the\\nseventeenth century. It acquired from the first an importance that left it no rapport with imprisonment as practiced\\n\\n(63)\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMADNESS & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nin the Middle Ages. As an economic measure and a social\\nprecaution, it had the value of inventiveness. But in the\\nhistory of unreason, it marked a decisive event: the moment when madness was perceived on the social horizon of\\npoverty, of incapacity for work, of inability to integrate\\nwith the group; the moment when madness began to rank\\namong the problems of the city. The new meanings assigned to poverty, the importance given to the obligation\\nto work, and all the ethical values that are linked to labor,\\nultimately determined the experience of madness and inflected its course.\\n\\nA sensibility was born which had drawn a line and laid a\\ncornerstone, and which chose—only to banish. The concrete space of classical society reserved a neutral region, a\\nblank page where the real life of the city was suspended;\\nhere, order no longer freely confronted disorder, reason no\\nlonger tried to make its own way among all that might\\nevade or seek to deny it. Here reason reigned in the pure\\nstate, in a triumph arranged for it in advance over a frenzied unreason. Madness was thus torn from that imaginary\\nfreedom which still allowed it to flourish on the Renaissance horizon. Not so long ago, it had floundered about in\\nbroad daylight; in King Lear, in Don Quixote. But in less\\nthan a half-century, it had been sequestered and, in the\\nfortress of confinement, bound to Reason, to the rules of\\nmorality and to their monotonous nights.\\n\\n(64)\\n\\x0c Introduction\\n\\nother. Thus, “Ships of Fools” crisscrossed the seas and\\ncanals of Europe with their comic and pathetic cargo of\\nsouls. Some of them found pleasure and even a cure in the\\nchanging surroundings, in the isolation of being cast off,\\nwhile others withdrew further, became worse, or died\\nalone and away from their families. The cities and villages\\nwhich had thus rid themselves of their crazed and crazy,\\ncould now take pleasure in watching the exciting sideshow\\nwhen a ship full of foreign lunatics would dock at their\\nharbors. The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw\\nmuch social unrest and economic depression, which they\\ntried to solve by imprisoning the indigents with the criminals and forcing them to work. The demented fitted quite\\nnaturally between those two extremes of social maladjustment and iniquity.\\n\\nA nice and hallowed tradition has labeled Tuke and Pinel\\nas the saviors of the mentally ill, but the truth of the matter\\nis not so simple. Many others had treated them with kindness, pleading that they belonged first and foremost with\\ntheir families, and for at least two hundred years before\\nthe 1780s, legislation had been considered or passed to\\nsegregate criminals and indigents from fools. But this legislation was prompted, as often as not, by a desire to protect\\nthe poor, the criminal, the man imprisoned for debts, and\\nthe juvenile delinquent from the frightening bestiality of\\nthe madman. As the madman had replaced the leper, the\\n\\n. mentally ill person was now a subhuman and beastly scapegoat; hence the need to protect others, While the Quaker\\nTuke applied his religious principles, first to demented\\n“friends” and later to foes also, partly to convert them, the\\ngreat Pinel was not sure at times that he was dealing with\\nsick people; he often marveled ac their unbelievable endurance of physical hardship, and often cited the ability of\\n\\n. schizophrenic women to sleep naked in subfreezing temperatures without suffering any ill effects. Were not these\\n\\n(vii)\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\x0c os\\n\\nxy\\n\\nTHE INSANE\\n\\nFrom the creation of the Hépital Général, from the opening, in Germany and in England, of the first houses of\\ncorrection, and until the end of the eighteenth century, the\\nage of reason confined. It confined the debauched, spend~\\nthrift fathers, prodigal sons, blasphemers, men who “seek to\\nundo themselves,” libertines. And through these parallels,\\nthese strange complicities, the age sketched the profile of its\\nown experience of wnreason.\\n\\nBut in each of these cities, we find an entire population\\nof madness as well. One-tenth of all the arrests made in\\nParis for the Hépital Général concern “the insane,” “demented” men, individuals of “wandering mind,” and “persons who have become completely mad.” Between these\\nand the others, no sign of a differentiation. Judging from\\nthe registries, the same sensibility appears to collect them,\\nthe same gestures to set them apart. We leave it to medical\\n\\n_archaeology to determine whether or not a man was sick,\\ncriminal, or insane who was admitted to the hospital for\\n\\n(65)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Mavwness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\n”\\n\\n“derangement of morals,” or because he had “mistreated\\nhis wife” and tried several times to kill himself.\\n\\nYer it must not be forgotten that the “insane” had as\\nsuch a particular place in the world of confinement. Their\\nstatus was not merely that of prisoners. In the general\\nsensibility to unreason, there appeared to be a special\\nmodulation which concerned madness proper, and was addressed to those called, without exact semantic distinction,\\ninsane, alienated, deranged, demented, extravagant.\\n\\nThis particular form of sensibility traces the features\\nproper to madness in the world of unreason. It is primarily\\nconcerned with scandal, In its most general form, confinement is explained, or at least justified, by the desire to avoid\\nscandal. It even signifies thereby an important change in\\nthe consciousness of evil. The Renaissance had freely allowed the forms of unreason to come out into the light of\\nday; public outrage gave evil the powers of example and\\nredemption. Gilles de Rais, accused, in the fifteenth century, of having been and of being “a heretic, an apostate, a\\nsorcerer, a sodomite, an invoker of evil spirits, a soothsayer,\\na slayer of innocents, an idolater, working evil by deviation\\nfrom the faith,” ended by himself admitting to crimes\\n“sufficient to cause the deaths of ten thousand persons” in\\nextrajudiciary confession; he repeated his avowal in Latin\\nbefore the tribunal; then he asked, of his own accord, that\\n“the said confession should be published in the vulgar\\ntongue and exhibited to each and every one of those present, the majority of whom knew no Latin, the publication\\nand confession to his shame of the said offenses by him\\ncommitted, in order the more easily to obtain the remission\\nof sins, and the mercy of God for the pardon of the sins by\\nhim committed.” Ar the trial, the same confession was required before those assembled: he “was told by the Presiding Judge that he should state his case fully, and the shame\\nthat he would gain thereby would serve to lessen the pun\\n(66)\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nThe Insane\\n\\nishment he would suffer hereafter.” Until the seventeenth\\ncentury, evil in all its most violent and most inhuman forms\\ncould not be dealt with and punished unless ic was brought\\ninto the open. The light in which confession was made and\\npunishment executed could alone balance the darkness\\nfrom which evil issued. In order to pass through all the\\nstages of its fulfillment, evil must necessarily incur public\\navowal and manifestation before reaching the conclusion\\nwhich suppresses it.\\n\\nConfinement, on the contrary, betrays a form of conscience to which the inhuman can suggest only shame.\\nThere are aspects of evil that have such a power of contagion, such a force of scandal that any publicicy multiplies\\nthem infinitely. Only oblivion can suppress them. In a case\\nof poisoning, Pontchartrain orders not a public trial but the\\nsecrecy of an asylum: “As the facts of the case concerned 2\\ngood part of Paris, the King did not believe that so many\\npeople should be brought to trial, many of whom had committed crimes unawares, and others only by the ease of\\ndoing so; His Majesty so determined the more readily insofar as he is persuaded that there are certain crimes which\\nmust absolutely be thrust into oblivion.”* Beyond the dangers of example, the honor of families and that of religion\\nsufficed to recommend a subject for a house of confinement, Apropos of a priest who was to be sent to SaintLazare: “Hence a priest such as this cannot be hidden away\\nwith too much care for the honor of religion and that of\\nthe priesthood.”? Even late in the eighteenth century,\\nMalesherbes would defend confinement as a right of families seeking to escape dishonor. “That which is called a base\\naction is placed in the rank of those which public order\\ndoes not permit us to tolerate. . . . It seems that the honor\\nof a family requires the disappearance from society of the\\nindividual who by vile and abject habits shames his relatives.” Inversely, liberation is in order when the danger of\\n\\n(67)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Mavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nscandal is past and the honor of families or of the Church\\ncan no longer be sullied. The Abbé Bargedé had been\\nconfined for a long time; never, despite his requests, had his —\\nrelease been authorized; but now old age and infirmity had\\nmade scandal impossible. ‘And besides, his paralysis persists,” writes d’Argenson, “he can neither write nor sign his\\nname; I think that there would be justice and charity in\\nsetting him free.” All those forms of evil that border on\\nunreason must be thrust into secrecy. Classicism felt a\\nshame in the presence of the inhuman that the Renaissance\\nhad never experienced.\\n\\nYet there is one exception in this consignment to secrecy:\\nthat which is made for madmen.* It was doubtless a very\\nold custom of the Middle Ages to display the insane. In\\ncertain of the Narrtiirmer in Germany, barred windows\\nhad been installed which permitted those outside to observe\\nthe madmen chained within. They thus constituted a spectacle at the city gates. The strange fact is that this custom\\ndid not disappear once the doors of the asylums closed, but\\nthat on the contrary it then developed, assuming in Paris\\nand London almost an institutional character. As late as\\n1815, if a report presented in the House of Commons is to\\nbe believed, the hospital of Bethlehem exhibited lunatics for\\na penny, every Sunday. Now the annual revenue from\\nthese exhibitions amounted to almost four hundred pounds;\\nwhich suggests the astonishingly high number of 96,000\\nvisits a year.* In France, the excursion to Bicétre and the\\ndisplay of the insane remained until the Revolution one of\\nthe Sunday distractions for the Left Bank bourgeoisie.\\nMirabeau reports in his Observations d’un voyageur anglais\\nthat the madmen at Bicétre were shown “like curious animails, to the first simpleton willing to pay a coin.” One\\nwent to see the keeper display the madmen the way the\\ntrainer at the Fair of Saint-Germain put the monkeys\\nthrough their tricks.’ Certain attendants were well known\\n\\n(68)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c     \\n\\n \\n   \\n\\nThe Insane\\n\\nfor their ability to make the mad perform dances and acrobatics, with 2 few flicks of the whip. The only extenuation\\nto be found at the end of the eighteenth century was that\\nthe mad were allowed to exhibit the mad, as if it were the\\nresponsibility of madness to testify to its own nature. “Let\\nus not slander human nature. The English traveler is right\\nto regard the office of exhibiting madmen as beyond the\\nmost hardened humanity. We have already said so. But all\\ndilemmas afford a remedy. It is the madmen themselves\\nwho are entrusted in their lucid intervals with displaying\\ntheir companions, who, in their turn, return the favor.\\nThus the keepers of these unfortunate creatures enjoy the\\nprofits that the spectacle affords, without indulging in a\\nheartlessness to which, no doubt, they could never descend.”® Here is madness elevated to spectacle above the\\nsilence of the asylums, and becoming a public scandal for\\nthe general delight. Unreason was hidden in the silence of\\nthe houses of confinement, but madness continued to be\\npresent on the stage of the world—with more commotion\\nthan ever. It would soon reach, under the Empire, a point\\nthat had never been attained in the Middle Ages and the\\nRenaissance; the strange Brotherhood of the Blue Ship had\\nonce given performances in which madness was mimed;\\nnow it was madness itself, madness in flesh and blood,\\nwhich put on the show. Early in the nineteenth century,\\nCoulmier, the director of Charenton, had organized those\\nfamous performances in which madmen sometimes played\\nthe roles of actors, sometimes those of watched spectators.\\n“The insane who attended these theatricals were the object\\nof the attention and curiosity of a frivolous, irresponsible,\\nand often vicious public. The bizarre attitudes of these unfortunates and their condition provoked the mocking\\nlaughter and the insulting pity of the spectators.”’ Madness\\nbecame pure spectacle, im a world over which Sade extended his sovereignty and which was offered as a diversion\\n\\n(69)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMadness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nto the good conscience of a reason sure of itself. Until the\\nbeginning of the nineteenth century, and to the indignation\\nof Royer-Collard, madmen remained monsters—that is,\\netymologically, beings or things to be shown.\\n\\nConfinement hid away unreason, and betrayed the shame\\nit aroused; but it explicitly drew attention to madness, pointed to it. If, in the case of unreason, the chief intention\\n‘was to avoid scandal, in the case of madness that intention\\nwas to organize it. A strange contradiction: the classical age\\nenveloped madness in a total experience of unreason; it reabsorbed its particular forms, which the Middle Ages and\\nthe Renaissance had clearly individualized into a general\\napprehension in which madness consorted indiscriminately\\nwith all the forms of unreason. But at the same time it\\nassigned to this same madness a special sign: not that of\\nsickness, but that of glorified scandal. Yet there is nothing\\nin common between this organized exhibition of madness in\\nthe eighteenth century and the freedom with which it came\\nto light during the Renaissance. In the Renaissance, madness was present everywhere and mingled with every experience by its images or its dangers. During the classical\\nperiod, madness was shown, but on the other side of bars; if\\npresent, it was at a distance, under the eyes of 2 reason that\\nno longer felt any relation to it and that would not compromise itself by too close a resemblance. Madness had become a thing to look at: no longer a monster inside oneself,\\nbut an animal with strange mechanisms, a bestiality from\\nwhich man had long since been suppressed. “I can easily\\nconceive of a man without hands, feet, head (for it is only\\nexperience which teaches us chat the head is more necessary\\nthan the feet), But I cannot conceive of man without\\nthought; that would be a stone or a brute.”*\\n\\nIn his Report on the Care of the Insane Desportes describes the cells of Bicétre as they were at the end of the\\neighteenth century: “The unfortunate whose entire furni\\n(79)\\n\\x0c The Insane\\n\\nture consisted of this straw pallet, lying with his head, feet,\\nand body pressed against the wall, could not enjoy sleep\\nwithout being soaked by the water that trickled from that\\nmass of stone.” As for the cells of La Salpétriére, what\\nmade “the place more miserable and often more fatal, was\\nthat in winter, when the waters of the Seine rose, those\\ncells situated at the level of the sewers became not only\\nmore unhealthy, but worse still, 2 refuge for a swarm of\\nhuge rats, which during the night attacked the unfortunates confined there and bit them wherever they could\\nreach them; madwomen have been found with feet, hands,\\nand faces torn by bites which are often dangerous and from\\nwhich several have died.” But these were the dungeons and\\ncells long reserved for the most dangerous and most violent\\nof the insane. If they were calmer, and if no one had anything to fear from them, they were crammed into wards of\\nvarying size. One of Samuel Tuke’s most active disciples,\\nGodfrey Higgins, had obtained the right, which cost him\\ntwenty pounds, to visit the asylum of York as a volunteer\\ninspector. In the course of a visit, he discovered a door that\\nhad been carefully concealed and found behind it 2 room,\\nnot eight feet on a side, which thirteen women occupied\\nduring the night; by day, they lived in a room scarcely\\nlarger,\\n\\nOn the other hand, when the insane were particularly\\ndangerous, they were constrained by a system which was\\ndoubtless not of a punitive nature, but simply intended to\\nfix within narrow limits the physical locus of a raging\\nfrenzy. Sufferers were generally chained to the walls and to\\nthe beds. At Bethlehem, violent madwomen were chained\\nby the ankles to the wall of a long gallery; their only garment was a homespun dress. At another hospital, in Bethnal\\nGreen, 2 woman subject to violent seizures was placed in a\\npigsty, feet and fists bound; when the crisis had passed she\\nwas tied to her bed, covered only by a blanket; when she\\n\\n(77)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Mavness & CivILIzATION\\n\\n‘was allowed to take a few steps, an iron bar was placed\\nbetween her legs, attached by rings to her ankles and by a\\nshort chain to handcuffs. Samuel Tuke, in his Report on\\nthe Condition of the Indigent Insane, gives the details of a\\ncomplicated system devised at Bethlehem to control a reputedly dangerous madman: he was attached by a long\\nchain that ran over the wall and thus permitted the attendant to lead him about, to keep him on a leash, so to speak,\\nfrom outside; around his neck had been placed an iron ring,\\nwhich was attached by a short chain to another ring; this\\nlatter slid the length of a vertical iron bar fastened to the\\nfloor and ceiling of the cell. When reforms began to be\\ninstituted at Bethlehem, a man was found who had lived in\\nthis cell, attached in this fashion, for twelve years.\\n\\nWhen practices reach this degree of violent intensity, it\\nbecomes clear that they are no longer inspired by the desire\\nto punish nor by the duty to correct. The notion of a\\n“resipiscence” is entirely foreign to this regime. But there\\n‘was a certain image of animality that haunted the hospitals\\nof the period. Madness borrowed its face from the mask of\\nthe beast. Those chained to the cell walls were no longer\\nmen whose minds had wandered, but beasts preyed upon\\nby a natural frenzy: as if madness, at its extreme point,\\nfreed from that moral unreason in which its most attenuated forms are enclosed, managed to rejoin, by a paroxysm\\nof strength, the immediate violence of animality. This\\nmodel of animality prevailed in the asylums and gave them\\ntheir cagelike aspect, their look of the menagerie. Coguel\\ndescribes La Salpétrigre at the end of the eighteenth century: “Madwomen seized with fits of violence are chained\\nlike dogs at their cell doors, and separated from keepers and\\nvisitors alike by a long corridor protected by an iron grille;\\nthrough this grille is passed their food and the straw on\\nwhich they sleep; by means of rakes, part of the filch that\\nsurrounds them is cleaned out.” At the hospital of Nantes,\\n\\n(72)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c The Insane\\n\\nthe menagerie appears to consist of individual cages for\\nwild beasts. Never had Esquirol seen “such an extravagance\\nof locks, of bolts, of iron bars to shut the doors of the\\ncells. . . . Tiny openings pierced next to the doors were\\nfitted with iron bars and shutters. Quite close to this opening hung a chain fastened to the wall and bearing at its end\\na cast-iron receptacle, somewhat resembling a wooden\\nshoe, in which food was placed and passed through the bars\\nof these openings.” When Frangois-Emmanuel Fodéré arrived at the hospital of Strasbourg in 1814, he found a kind\\nof human stable, constructed with great care and skill: “for\\ntroublesome madmen and those who dirtied themselves, 2\\nkind of cage, or wooden closet, which could at the most\\ncontain one man of middie height, had been devised at the\\nends of the great wards.” These cages had gratings for\\nfloors, and did not rest on the ground but were raised about\\nfifteen centimeters. Over these gratings was thrown a little\\nstraw “upon which the madman lay, naked or nearly so,\\ntook his meals, and deposited his excrement.”\\n\\nThis, to be sure, is a whole security system against the\\nviolence of the insane and the explosion of their fury. Such\\noutbursts are regarded chiefly as a social danger. But what\\nis most important is that it is conceived in terms of an\\nanimal freedom, The negative fact that “the madman is not\\ntreated like a human being” has a very positive content:\\nthis inhuman indifference actually has an obsessional value:\\nit is rooted in the old fears which since antiquity, and especially since the Middle Ages, have given the animal world\\nits familiar strangeness, its menacing marvels, its entire\\nweight of dumb anxiety. Yet this animal fear which accompanies, with all its imaginary landscape, the perception\\nof madness, no longer has the same meaning it had two or\\nthree centuries earlier: animal metamorphosis is no longer\\nthe visible sign of infernal powers, nor the result of a diabolic alchemy of unreason. The animal in man no longer\\n\\n(73)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c Mavness & CivILIZATION\\n\\nhas any value as the sign of a Beyond; it has become his\\nmadness, without relation to anything but itself: his madness in the state of nature. The animality that rages in\\nmadness dispossesses man of what is specifically human in\\nhim; not in order to deliver him over to other powers, but\\nsimply to establish him at the zero degree of his own nature. For classicism, madness in its ultimate form is man in\\nimmediate relation to his animality, without other reference, without any recourse.\\n\\nThe day would come when from an evolutionary perspective this presence of animality in madness would be\\nconsidered as the sign—indeed, as the very essence—of\\ndisease. In the classical period, on the contrary, it manifested the very fact that the madman was not a sick man,\\nAnimality, in fact, protected the lunatic from whatever\\nmight be fragile, precarious, or sickly in man. The animal _\\nsolidity of madness, and that density it borrows from the\\nblind world of beasts, inured the madman to hunger, heat,\\ncold, pain. It was common knowledge until the end of the\\neighteenth century that the insane could support the miseries of existence indefinitely. There was no need to protect\\nthem; they had no need to be covered or warmed. When,\\nin 1811, Samuel Tuke visited a workhouse in the Southern\\nCounties, he saw cells where the daylight passed through\\nlittle barred windows that had been cut in the doors. All\\nthe women were entirely naked. Now “the temperature\\nwas extremely rigorous, and the evening of the day before,\\nthe thermometer had indicated a cold of 18 degrees. One\\nof these unfortunate women was lying on a little straw,\\nwithout covering.” This ability of the insane to endure, like\\nanimals, the worst inclemencies was stil] a medical dogma\\nfor Pinel; he would always admire “the constancy and the\\nease with which certain of the insane of both sexes bear the\\nmost rigorous and prolonged cold. In the month of Nivése of the Year III, on certain days when the ther\\n(74)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\npeople more healthy, more resistant than ordinary human\\nbeings? Didn’t they have too much animal spirit in them?\\nNaturally, it is impossible to discuss a book as complex as\\nMadness and Civilization without oversimplifying and doing it an injustice. It is a tale of nuances, relative values, and\\ndelicate shadings. Yet, it is an impressive monument: in a\\ndispassionate manner it marshals overwhelming evidence to\\ndispel more effectively than many previous attempts the\\nmyth of mental illness, and re-establishes folly and unreason in their rightful place as complex, human—too human—phenomena. The roots and symptoms of folly are\\nbeing looked for today in psychology, medicine, and sociology, but they were and still are as present and important\\nin art,* religion, ethics, and epistemology. Madness is really\\na manifestation of the “soul,” 2 variable concept which\\nfrom antiquity to the twentieth century covered approximately what came to be known, after Freud, as the unconscious part of the human mind.t Only time will tell how\\nmuch better students of the psyche can look at the future,\\nafter reading this sobering re-creation of yesteryear’s mad~\\nness and the ineffective attempts of humanity to treat it by\\namputation, projections, prejudices, and segregation.\\n\\nJosé Barcuiton, M.D.\\n\\n* My only quarrel] with the book is the lack of emphasis on the humoristic elements in psychoses and neuroses: i.e., the patient laughs at himself, or laughs at the world through his illness.\\n\\n+ The fear and dread of madness is as real a factor in social and medical\\nattitudes or measures as anxiety, symptoms, and resistance in coping with\\nimpulses from the individual unconscious; even though the author does\\nnot explicitly compare madness with the unconscious, he equates madness and dream activity so that the inference is clear enough.\\n\\n(vili)\\n\\x0c The Insane\\n\\nmometer indicated 10, 11, and as many as 16 degrees below\\nfreezing, a madman in the hospital of Bicétre could not\\nendure his wool blanket, and remained sitting on the icy\\nfloor of his cell. In the morning, one no sooner opened his\\ndoor than he ran in his shirt into the inner court, taking\\nice and snow by the fistful, applying it to his breast and\\nletting it melt with a sort of delectation.” Madness, insofar\\nas it partook of animal ferocity, preserved man from the\\ndangers of disease; it afforded him an invulnerability, similar to that which nature, in its foresight, had provided for.\\nanimals. Curiously, the disturbance of his reason restored\\nthe madman to the immediate kindness of nature by a return to animality.\\n\\nThis is why, at this extreme point, madness was less than\\never linked to medicine; nor could it be linked to the domain of correction. Unchained animality could be mastered\\nonly by discipline and brutalizing. The theme of the animalmadman was effectively realized in the eighteenth century,\\nin occasional attempts to impose a certain pedagogy on the\\ninsane. Pinel cites the case of a “very famous monastic\\nestablishment, in one of the southern regions of France,”\\nwhere a violent madman would be given “a precise order to\\nchange”; if he refused to go to bed or to eat, he “was\\nwarned that obstinacy in his deviations would be punished\\non the next day with ten strokes of the bullwhip.” If, on\\nthe contrary, he was submissive and docile, he was allowed\\n“to take his meals in the refectory, next to,the disciplinarian,” but at the least transgression, he was instantly admonished by a “heavy blow of a rod across his fingers.”\\nThus, by the use of a curious dialectic whose movement\\nexplains all these “inhuman” practices of confinement, the\\nfree animality of madness was tamed only by such discipline whose meaning was not to raise the bestial to the\\nhuman, but to restore man to what was purely animal\\nwithin him. Madness discloses a secret of animality which is\\n\\n(75)\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\n \\n\\nMavwness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nits own truth, and in which, in some way, it is reabsorbed.\\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, a farmer in\\nthe north of Scotland had his hour of fame. He was said to\\npossess the art of curing insanity, Pinel notes in passing that\\nthis Gregory had the physique of a Hercules: “His method\\nconsisted in forcing the insane to perform the most difficult\\ntasks of farming, in using them as beasts of burden, as servants, in reducing them to an ultimate obedience with a\\nbarrage of blows at the least act of revolt.” In the reduction\\nto animality, madness finds both its truth and its cure;\\nwhen the madman has become a beast, this presence of the\\nanimal in man, a presence which constituted the scandal of\\nmadness, is eliminated: not that the animal is silenced, but\\nman himself is abolished. In the human being who has become a beast of burden, the absence of reason follows wisdom and its order: madness is then cured, since it is alienated in something which is no less than its truth.\\n\\nA moment would come when, from this animality of\\nmadness, would be deduced the idea of a mechanistic psychology, and the notion that the forms of madness can be\\nreferred to the great structures of animal life. But in the\\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the animality that\\nlends its face to madness in no way stipulates a determinist\\nnature for its phenomena. On the contrary, it locates madness in an area of unforeseeable freedom where frenzy is\\nunchained; if determinism can have any effect on it, it is in\\nthe form of constraint, punishment, or discipline. Through\\nanimality, madness does not join the great laws of nature\\nand of life, but rather the thousand forms of a bestiary. But\\nunlike the one popular in the Middle Ages, which illustrated, in so many symbolic visages, the metamorphoses of\\nevil, this was an abstract bestiary; here evil no longer assumed its fantastic body; here we apprehend only its most\\nextreme form, the truth of the beast which is a truth without content. Evil is freed from all that its wealth of icono\\n(76)\\n\\x0c The Insane\\n\\ngraphic fauna could do, to preserve only a general power of\\nintimidation: the secret danger of an animaliry chat lies in\\nwait and, all at once, undoes reason in violence and truth in\\nthe madman’s frenzy. Despite the contemporary effort to\\nconstitute a positivist zoology, this obsession with an animality perceived as the natural locus of madness continued\\nto people the hell of the classical age. It was this obsession\\nthat created the imagery responsible for all the practices of\\nconfinement and the strangest aspects of its savagery.\\n\\nIt has doubtless been essential to Western culture to link,\\nas it has done, its perception of madness to the iconographic\\nforms of the relation of man to beast. From the start,\\nWestern culture has not considered it evident that animals\\nparticipate in the plenitude of nature, in its wisdom and its\\norder: this idea was a late one and long remained on the\\nsurface of culture; perhaps it has not yet penetrated very\\ndeeply into the subterranean regions of the imagination. In\\nfact, on close examination, it becomes evident that the\\nanimal belongs rather to an anti-nature, to a negativity that\\nthreatens order and by its frenzy endangers the positive\\nwisdom of nature. The work of Lautréamont bears witness\\nto this. Why should the fact that Western man has lived\\nfor two thousand years on his definition as a rational animal\\nnecessarily mean that he has recognized the possibility of an\\norder common to reason and to animality? Why should he\\nhave necessarily designated, by this definition, the way in\\nwhich he inserts himself in natural positiviry? Independently of what Aristotle really meant, may we not assume\\nthat for the West this “rational animal” has long been the\\nmeasure of the way in which reason’s freedom functioned\\nin the locus of unreason, diverging from it until it constituted its opposite term? From the moment philosophy became anthropology, and man sought to recognize himself\\nin a natural plenitude, the animal lost its power of negativity, in order to become, between the determinism of nature\\n\\n(77)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavpness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nand the reason of man, the positive form of an evolution.\\nThe formula of the “rational animal” has utterly changed\\nits meaning: the unreason it suggested as the origin of all\\npossible reason has entirely disappeared, Henceforth madness must obey the determinism of man perceived as a natural being in his very animality. In the classical age, if it is\\ntrue that the scientific and medical analysis of madness, as\\nwe shall see below, sought to establish ic within this natural\\nmechanism, the real practices that concern the insane bear\\nsufficient witness to the fact that madness was still contained in the anti-natural violence of animality.\\n\\nIn any case, it was this animality of madness which confinement glorified, at the same time that it sought to avoid\\nthe scandal inherent in the immorality of the unreasonable.\\nWhich reveals the distance established in the classical age\\nbetween madness and the other forms of unreason, even if\\nit is true that from a certain point of view they had been\\nidentified or assimilated. If a whole range of unreason was\\nreduced to silence, but madness left free to speak the language of its scandal, what lesson could it teach which unreason as a whole was not capable of transmitting? What\\nmeaning had the frenzies and all the fury of the insane,\\nwhich could not be found in the—probably more sensible—remarks of the other internees? In what respect\\nthen was madness more particularly significant?\\n\\nBeginning with the seventeenth century, unreason in the\\nmost general sense no longer had much instructive value.\\nThat perilous reversibility of reason which was still so close\\nfor the Renaissance was to be forgotten, and its scandals\\nwere to disappear. The great theme of the madness of the\\nCross, which belonged so intimately to the Christian experience of the Renaissance, began to disappear in the seventeenth century, despite Jansenism and Pascal. Or rather, it\\nsubsisted, but changed and somehow inverted its meaning.\\n\\n(78)\\n\\x0c The Insane\\n\\nIt was no longer a matter of requiring human reason to\\nabandon its pride and its certainties in order to lose itself in\\nthe great unreason of sacrifice. When classical Christianity\\nspeaks of the madness of the Cross, it is merely to humiliate\\nfalse reason and add luster to the eternal light of truth; the\\nmadness of God-in-man’s-image is simply a wisdom not\\nrecognized by the men of unreason who live in this world:\\n“Jesus crucified . . . was the scandal of the world and appeared as nothing but ignorance and madness to the eyes of\\nhis time.” But the fact that the world has become Christian,\\nand that the order of God is revealed through the meanderings of history and the madness of men, now suffices to\\nshow that “Christ has become the highest point of our wisdom.”* The scandal of Christian faith and Christian abasement, whose strength and value as revelation Pascal still\\npreserved, would soon have no more meaning for Christian\\nthought except perhaps to reveal in these scandalized con\\n\" sciences so many blind souls: “Do not permit your Cross,\\nwhich has subdued the universe for you, to be still the\\nmadness and scandal of proud minds.” Christian unreason\\nwas relegated by Christians themselves into the margins of\\na reason that had become identical with the wisdom of\\nGod incarnate. After Port-Royal, men would have to wait\\ntwo centuries—until Dostoievsky and Nietzsche—for Christ\\nto regain the glory of his madness, for scandal to recover its\\npower as revelation, for unreason to cease being merely the\\npublic shame of reason,\\n\\nBut at the very moment Christian reason rid itself of the\\nmadness that had so long been a part of itself, the madman,\\nin his abolished reason, in the fury of his animality, received a singular power as a demonstration: it was as if\\nscandal, driven out of that superhuman region where ic\\nrelated to God and where the Incarnation was manifested,\\nreappeared, in the plenitude of its force and pregnant with a\\nnew lesson, in that region where man has a relation to na\\n(79)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nture and to his animality. The Jesson’s point of application\\nhas shifted to the lower regions of madness. The Cross is no\\nlonger to be considered in its scandal; but it must not be\\nforgotten that throughout his human life Christ honored\\nmadness, sanctified it as he sanctified infirmity cured, sin\\nforgiven, poverty assured of eternal riches. Saint Vincent\\nde Paul reminds those assigned to tend the mad within the\\nhouses of confinement that their “rule in this is Our Lord\\nwho chose to be surrounded by lunatics, demoniacs, madmen, the tempted and the possessed.” These men ruled by\\nthe powers of the inhuman constitute, around those who\\nrepresent eternal Wisdom, around the Man who incarnates\\nit, a perpetual occasion for glorification: because they\\nglorify, by surrounding it, the wisdom that has been denied\\nthem, and at the same time give it a pretext to humiliate\\nitself, to acknowledge that it is granted only by grace. Further: Christ did not merely choose to be surrounded by\\nlunatics; he himself chose to pass in their eyes for a madman, thus experiencing, in his incarnation, all the sufferings\\nof human misfortune. Madness thus became the ultimate\\nform, the final degree of God in man’s image, before the\\nfulfillment and deliverance of the Cross:“O my Savior, you\\nwere pleased to be a scandal to the Jews, and a madness to\\nthe Gentiles; you were pleased to seem out of your senses,\\nas it is reported in the Holy Gospel that it was thought of\\nOur Lord that he had gone mad. Dicebant quoniam in\\nfurorem versus est. His Apostles sometimes looked upon\\nhim as a man in anger, and he seemed such to them, so that\\nthey should bear witness that he had borne with all our\\ninfirmities and all our states of affliction, and to teach them\\nand us as well to have compassion upon those who fall into\\nthese infirmities.”*° Coming into this world, Christ agreed\\nto take upon himself all the signs of the human condition\\nand the very stigmata of fallen nature; from poverty to\\n\\n(80)\\n\\x0c  \\n\\nThe Insane\\n\\ndeath, he followed the Jong road of the Passion, which was\\nalso the road of the passions, of wisdom forgotten, and of\\nmadness, And because it was one of the forms of the Passion—the ultimate form, in a sense, before death—madness\\nwould now become, for those who suffered it, an object of\\nrespect and compassion.\\n\\nTo respect madness is not to interpret it as the involuntary and inevitable accident of disease, but to recognize this\\nlower limit of human truth, a limit not accidental but essential. As death is the limit of human life in the realm of time,\\nmadness is its limit in the realm of animalicy, and just as\\ndeath had been sanctified by the death of Christ, madness,\\nin its most bestial nature, had also been sanctified. On\\nMarch 29, 1654, Saint Vincent de Paul announced to Jean\\nBarreau, himself a congreganist, that his brother had just\\nbeen confined at Saint-Lazare as a lunatic: “We must\\nhonor Our Lord in the state wherein He was when they\\nsought to bind Him, saying quoniam in frenesim versus est,\\nin order to sanctify that state in those whom His Divine\\nProvidence has placed there.”\"* Madness is the lowest\\npoint of humanity to which God submitted in His incarnation, thereby showing that there was nothing inhuman in\\nman that could not be redeemed and saved; the ultimate\\npoint of the Fall was glorified by the divine presence: and\\nit is this lesson which, for the seventeenth century, all madness stil! taught.\\n\\nWe see why the scandal of madness could be exalted,\\nwhile that of the other forms of unreason was concealed\\nwith so much care. The scandal of unreason produced only\\nthe contagious example of transgression and immorality;\\nthe scandal of madness showed men how close to animality\\ntheir Fall could bring them; and at the same time how far\\ndivine mercy could extend when it consented to save man.\\nFor Renaissance Christianity, the entire instructive value of\\n\\n(82)\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\n \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nunreason and of its scandals lay in the madness of the Incarnation of God in man. For classicism, the Incarnation is\\nno longer madness; but what is madness is this incarnation\\nof man in the beast, which is, as the ultimate point of his\\nFall, the most manifest sign of his guilt; and, as the ulamate\\nobject of divine mercy, the symbol of universal forgiveness\\nand innocence regained. Henceforth, all the lessons of madness and the power of its instruction must be sought in this\\nobscure region, at the lower confines of humanity, where\\nman is hinged to nature, where he is both ultimate downfall\\nand absolute innocence. Does not the Church’s solicitude\\nfor the insane during the classical period, as it is symbolized\\nin Saine Vincent de Paul and his Congregation, or in the\\nBrothers of Charity, all those religious orders hovering\\nover madness and showing it to the world—does this not\\nindicate that the Church found in madness a difficult but an\\nessential lesson: the guilty innocence of the animal in man?\\nThis is the lesson to be read and understood in its spectacles, in which it exalted in the madman the fury of the\\nhuman beast. Paradoxically, this Christian consciousness of\\nanimality prepared the moment when madness would be\\ntreated as a fact of nature; it would then be quickly forgotten what this “nature” meant for classical thought: not\\nthe always accessible domain of an objective analysis, but\\nthat region in which there appears, for man, the always\\npossible scandal of a madness that is both his ultimate truth\\nand the form of his abolition.\\n\\nAll these phenomena, these strange practices woven\\naround madness, these usages which glorify and at the same\\ntime discipline it, reduce it to animality while making it\\nteach the lesson of the Redemption, put madness in a\\nstrange position with regard to unreason as a whole. In the\\nhouses of confinement, madness cohabits with all the forms\\n\\n(82)\\n\\x0c  \\n\\nThe Insane\\n\\nof unreason which envelop it and define its most general\\ntruth; and yet madness is isolated, treated in a special manner, manifested in its singularity as if, though belonging to\\nunreason, it nonetheless traversed that domain by a movement peculiar to itself, ceaselessly referring from itself to its\\nmost paradoxical extreme.\\n\\nWe have now got in the habit of perceiving in madness a\\nfall into a determinism where all forms of liberty are gradually suppressed; madness shows us nothing more than the\\nnatural constants of a determinism, with the sequences of\\nits causes, and the discursive movement of its forms; for\\nmadness threatens modern man only with that return to the\\nbleak world of beasts and things, to their fetrered freedom.\\nIt is not on this horizon of nature that the seventeenth and\\neighteenth centuries recognized madness, but against a\\nbackground of Unreason; madness did not disclose a mechanism, but revealed a liberty raging in the monstrous forms\\nof animality, We no longer understand unreason today,\\nexcept in its epithetic form: the Unreasonable, a sign attached to conduct or speech, and betraying to the layman\\'s\\neyes the presence of madness and all its pathological train;\\nfor us the unreasonable is only one of madness’s modes of\\nappearance. On the contrary, unreason, for classicism, had\\na nominal value; it constituted 2 kind of substantial function. It was in relation to unreason and to it alone that\\nmadness could be understood. Unreason was its support; or\\nlet us say that unreason defined the locus of madness’s possibility. For classical man, madness was not the natural condition, the human and psychological root of unreason; it\\nwas only unreason’s empirical form; and the madman,\\ntracing the course of human degradation to the frenzied\\nnadir of animality, disclosed that underlying realm of unreason which threatens man and envelops—at a tremendous\\ndistance--all the forms of his natural existence. It was not a\\n\\n(83)\\n\\n \\n\\x0c  \\n\\nMavness & CIVILIZATION\\n\\nquestion of tending toward a determinism, but of being\\nswallowed up by a darkness. More effectively than any\\nother kind of rationalism, better in any case than our posi~\\ntivism, classical rationalism could watch out for and guard\\nagainst the subterranean danger of unreason, that threatening space of an absolute freedom,\\n\\n(84)\\n\\x0c'"
