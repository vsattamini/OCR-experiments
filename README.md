# OCR-experiments
The goal of this project is to experiment with different ways to implement image-to-text. The motivation is personal, in order to speed up data entry for a team schedule updater. 
    
The system from where the original text comes from is isolated from other computers, so it's necessary to photograph and re-type the original text in a Trello notebook. Currently, a commercial app is being used, downloaded from the playstore. theapp, however, is full of ads, and the speed of it is lacking. 

There are 3 ways I will attempt to implement here:
- Pytesseract: a ready-to-use package that I will import
- Transfer learning: I will see is HuggingFace has any models
- My own model: based on what I learn from the previous experiments, I will attempt to develop my own model.
