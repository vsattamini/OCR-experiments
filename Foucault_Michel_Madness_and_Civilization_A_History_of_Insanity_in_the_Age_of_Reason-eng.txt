Pascat: “Men are so necessarily mad, that not to be mad
would amount to another form of madness.” And Dostoi-
evsky, in bis piany oF A writer: “It is not by confining
one’s neighbor that one is convinced of one’s own sanity.”

We have yet to write the history of that other form of
madness, by which men, in an act of sovereign reason, con-
fine their neighbors, and communicate and recognize each
other through the merciless language of non-madness; to
define the moment of this conspiracy before it was perma-
nently established in the realm of truth, before it was re-
vived by the lyricism of protest. We must try to return, in
history, to that zero point in the course of madness at
which madness is an undifferentiated experience, a not yet
divided experience of division itself. We must describe,
from the start of its trajectory, that “other form” whicb
relegates Reason and Madness to one side or the other of its
action as things henceforth external, deaf to all exchange,
and as though dead to one another.

This is doubtless an uncomfortable region. To explore it
we must renounce the convenience of terminal truths, and
never let ourselves be guided by what we may know of
madness. None of the concepts of psychopathology, even
and especially in the implicit process of retrospections, can
play an organizing role. What is constitutive is the action
that divides madness, and not the science elaborated once
this division is made and calm restored. What is originative
is the caesura that establishes the distance between reason
and non-reason; reason’s subjugation of non-reason, wrest-

PASSION AND
DELIRIUM

Tue savage danger of madness is related to the danger of
the passions and to their fatal concatenation,

Sauvages had sketched the fundamental role of passion,
citing it as a more constant, more persistent, and somehow
more deserved cause of madness: “The distraction of our
mind is the result of our blind surrender to our desires, our
incapacity to control or to moderate our passions. Whence
these amorous frenzies, these antipathies, these depraved
tastes, this melancholy which is caused by grief, these
transports wrought in us by denial, these excesses in eating,
in drinking, these indispositions, these corporeal vices which
cause madness, the worst of all maladies.”* But as yet, what
was involved was only passion’s moral precedence, its re-
sponsibility, in a vague way; the real target of this denunci-
ation was the radical relation of the phenomena of madness
to the very possibility of passion.

Mavness & CIVILIZATION

Before Descartes, and long after his influence as philoso-
pher and physiologist had diminished, passion continued to
be the meeting ground of body and soul; the point where
the latter’s activity makes contact with the former’s passiv-
ity, each being a limit imposed upon the other and the locus
of their communication.

The medicine of humors sees this unity primarily as a
reciprocal interaction: “The passions necessarily cause cer-
tain movements in the humors; anger agitates the bile, sad-
ness excites melancholy (black bile), and the movements
of the humors are on occasion so violent that they disrupt
the entire economy of the body, even causing death; fur-
ther, the passions augment the quantity of the humors;
anger multiplies the bile as sadness increases melancholy.
The humors which are customarily agitated by certain pas-
sions dispose those in whom they abound to the same
passions, and to thinking of the objects which ordinarily
excite them; bile disposes to anger and to thinking of those
we hate. Melancholy (black bile) disposes to sadness and
to thinking of untoward things; well-tempered blood dis-
poses to joy.”

The medicine of spirits substitutes for this vague idea of
“disposition” the rigor of 2 physical, mechanical transmis-
sion of movements. If the passions are possible only in 2
being which has a body, and a body not entirely subject to
the light of its mind and to the immediate transparence of
its will, this is true insofar as, in ourselves and without
ourselves, and generally in spite of ourselves, the mind’s
movements obey a mechanical structure which is that of
the movement of spirits. “Before the sight of the object of
passion, the animal spirits were spread throughout the en-
ure body in order to preserve all the parts in general; but at
the presence of the new object, this entire economy is dis-
rupted. The majority of spirits are impelled into the
muscles of the arms, the legs, the face, and all the exterior

(86)
     

 
   

Passion and Delirium

parts of the body in order to afford it a disposition proper
to the prevailing passion and to give it the countenance and
movement necessary for the acquisition of the good or the
escape from the evil which presents irself.”® Passion thus
disperses the spirits, which are disposed to passion: that is,
under the effect of passion and in the presence of its object,
the spirits circulate, disperse, and concentrate according to a
spatial design which licenses the trace of the object in the
brain and its image in the soul, thus forming in the body a
kind of geometric figure of passion which is merely its ex-
pressive transposition; but which also constitutes passion’s
essential causal basis, for when all the spirits are grouped
around this object of passion, or at least around its image,
the mind in its turn can no longer ignore it and will conse-
quently be subject to passion.

One more step, and the entire system becomes a unity in
which body and soul communicate immediately in the sym-
bolic values of common qualities. This is what happens in
the medicine of solids and fluids, which dominates eigh-
teenth-century practice. Tension and release, hardness and
softness, rigidity and relaxation, congestion and dryness—
these qualitative states characterize the soul as much as the
body, and ultimately refer to a kind of indistinct and com-
posite passional situation, one which imposes itself on the
concatenation of ideas, on the course of feelings, on the
state of fibers, on the circulation of fluids. The theme of
causality here appears as too discursive, the elements it
groups too disjunct for its schemas to be applicable. Are
the “active passions, such as anger, joy, lust,” causes or
consequences “of the excessive strength, the excessive ten-
sion, and the excessive elasticity of the nervous fibers, and
of the excessive activity of the nervous fluid”? Conversely,
cannot the “inert passions, such as fear, depression, ennui,
lack of appetite, the coldness that accompanies homesick-
ness, bizarre appetites, stupidiry, lack of memory” be as

(87)
  

Mavness & CIVILIZATION

readily followed as they are preceded by “weakness of the
brain marrow and of the nervous fibers distributed in the
organs, by impoverishment and inertia of the fluids”?* In-
deed, we must no longer try to situate passion in a causal
succession, or halfway between the corporeal and the spir-
itual; passion indicates, at a new, deeper level, that the soul
and the body are in a perpetual metaphorical relation in
which qualities have no need to be communicated because
they are already common to both; and in which phe-
nomena of expression are not causes, quite simply because
soul and body are always each other’s immediate expres-
sion. Passion is no longer exactly at the geometrical center
of the body-and-soul complex; it is, a little short of that, at
the point where their opposition is not yet given, in that
region where both their unity and their distinction are estab-
lished.

But at this level, passion is no fonger simply one of the
causes—however powerful—of madness; rather it forms
the basis for its very possibility. If it is true that there exists
a realm, in the relations of soul and body, where cause and
effect, determinism and expression still intersect in a web so
dense that they actually form only one and the same move-
ment which cannot be dissociated except after the fact; if it
is true that prior to the violence of the body and the vivac-
ity of the soul, prior to the softening of the fibers and che
relaxation of the mind, there are qualitative, as yet un-
shared kinds of @ priori which subsequently impose the
same values on the organic and on the spiritual, then we see
that there can be diseases such as madness which are from
the start diseases of the body and of the soul, maladies in
which the affection of the brain is of the same quality, of
the same origin, of the same nature, finally, as the affection
of the soul.

The possibility of madness is therefore implicit in the
very phenomenon of passion.

(88)
 Passion and Delirium

Tr is true that long before the eighteenth century, and for
a long series of centuries from which we have doubtless not
emerged, passion and madness were kept in close relation to
one another. But let us allow the classical period its original-
ity. The moralists of the Greco-Latin tradition had found
it just that madness be passion’s chastisement; and to be
more certain that this was the case, they chose to define
passion as a temporary and attenuated madness. But class-
ical thought could define a relation between passion and
madness which was not on the order of a pious hope, a
pedagogic threat, or a moral synthesis; it even broke with
the tradition by inverting the terms of the concatenation; it
based the chimeras of madness on the nature of passion; it
saw that the determinism of the passions was nothing but a
chance for madness to penetrate the world of reason; and
that if the unquestioned union of body and soul manifested
man’s finitude in passion, it laid this same man open, at the
same time, to the infinite movement that destroyed him.

Madness, then, was not merely one of the possibilities
afforded by the union of soul and body; it was not just
one of the consequences of passion. Instiruted by the unity
of soul and body, madness turned against that unity and
once again put it in question, Madness, made possible by
passion, threatened by a movement proper to itself what
had made passion itself possible. Madness was one of those
unities in which laws were compromised, perverted,
distorted—thereby manifesting such unity as evident and
established, but also as fragile and already doomed to de-
struction.

There comes a moment in the course of passion when
laws are suspended as though of their own accord, when
movement either abruptly stops, without collision or ab-
sorption of any kind of active force, or is propagated, the
action ceasing only at the climax of the paroxysm. Whytt
admits that an intense emotion can provoke madness ex-

(89)

 
  

MavNESS & CIVILIZATION

actly as impact can provoke movement, for the sole reason
that emotion is both impact in the soul and agitation of the
nervous fiber: “It is thus that sad narratives or those ca-
pable of moving the heart, a horrible and unexpected sight,
great grief, rage, terror, and the other passions which
make a great impression frequently occasion the most sud-
den and violent nervous symptoms.” But—it is here that
madness, strictly speaking, begins—it happens that this
movement immediately cancels itself out by its own excess
and abruptly provokes an immobility which may reach the
point of death itself. As if in the mechanics of madness,
Tepose were not necessarily a quiescent thing but could also
be a movement in violent opposition to itself, a movement
which under the effect of its own violence abruptly
achieves contradiction and the impossibility of contnu-
ance. “It is not unheard of that the passions, being very
violent, generate a kind of tetanus or catalepsy such that
the person then resembles a statue more than a living being.
Further, fear, affliction, joy, and shame carried to their ex-
cess have more than once been followed by sudden
death.”®

Conversely, it happens that movement, passing from soul
to body and from body to soul, propagates itself indefi-
nitely in a locus of anxiety certainly closer to that space
where Malebranche placed souls than to that in which Des-
cartes situated bodies. Imperceptible movements, often pro-
voked by a slight external impact, accumulate, are ampli-
fied, and end by exploding in violent convulsions. Giovanni
Maria Lancisi had already explained that the noble Romans
were often subject to the vapors—hysterical attacks, hypo-
chondriacal fits—because in their court life “their minds,
continually agitated between fear and hope, never knew a
moment's repose.” According to many physicians, cicy life,
the life of the court, of the salons, led to madness by this
multiplicity of excitations constantly accumulated, pro-

(90)
  

Passion and Delirium

longed, and echoed without ever being attenuated. But
there is in this image, in its more intense forms, and in the
events constituting its organic version, a certain force
which, increasing, can lead to delirium, as if movement, in-
stead of losing its strength in communicating itself, could
involve other forces in its wake, and from them derive an
additional vigor. This was how Sauvages explained the
origin of madness: a certain impression of fear is linked to
the congestion or the pressure of 2 certain medullary fiber;
this fear is limited to an object, as this congestion is strictly
localized. In proportion as this fear persists, the soul grants
it more attention, increasingly isolating and detaching it
from all else. But such isoladon reinforces the fear, and the
soul, having accorded it too special a condition, gradually
tends to attach to it a whole series of more or less remote
ideas: “It joins to this simple idea all those which are likely
to nourish and augment it. For example, a man who sup-
poses in his sleep that he is being accused of a crime, im-
mediately associates this idea with that of its satellites—
judges, executioners, the gibbet.” And from being thus
burdened with all these new elements, involving them in its
course, the idea assumes a kind of additional power which
ultimately renders it irresistible even to the most concerted
efforts of the will.

Madness, which finds its first possibility in the phenome-
non of passion, and in the deployment of thar double cau-
sality which, starting from passion itself, radiates both to-
ward the body and toward the soul, is at the same time
suspension of passion, breach of causality, dissolution of the
elements of this unity. Madness participates both in the
necessity of passion and in the anarchy of what, released by
this very passion, transcends it and ultimately contests all it
implies. Madness ends by being a movement of the nerves
and muscles so violent that nothing in the course of images,
ideas, or wills seems to correspond to it: this is the case of

(97)
  

Mapness & CIVILIZATION

mania when it is suddenly intensified into convulsions, or
when it degenerates into continuous frenzy. Conversely,
madness can, in the body’s repose or inertia, generate and
then maintain an agitation of the soul, without pause or
pacification, as is the case in melancholia, where external
objects do not produce the same impression on the suffer-
er’s mind as on that of a healthy man; “his impressions are
weak and he rarely pays attention to them; his mind is
almost totally absorbed by the vivacity of certain ideas.”*

Indeed this dissociation between the external movements
of the body and the course of ideas does not mean that the
unity of body and soul is necessarily dissolved, nor that
each recovers its autonomy in madness. Doubtless the unity
is compromised in its rigor and in its totality; but it is fis-
sured, it turns out, along lines which do not abolish it, but
divide it into arbitrary sectors. For when melancholia fixes
upon an aberrant idea, it is not only the soul which is
involved; it is the soul with the brain, the soul with the
nerves, their origin and their fibers: a whole segment of the
unity of soul and body is thus detached from the aggregate
and especially from the organs by which reality is per-
ceived. The same thing occurs in convulsions and agitation:
the soul is not excluded from the body, but is swept along
so rapidly by it that it cannot retain all its conceptions; it is
separated from its memories, its intentions, its firmest ideas,
and thus isolated from itself and from all chat remains stable
in the body, it surrenders itself to the most mobile fibers;
nothing in its behavior is henceforth adapted to reality, to
truth, or to prudence; though the fibers in their vibration
may imitate what is happening in the perceptions, the
sufferer cannot tell the difference: “The rapid and chaotic
pulsations of the arteries, or whatever other derangement
occurs, imprints this same movement on the fibers (as in
perception); they will represent as present objects which
are not so, as true those which are chimerical.””

(92)
  

 

Passion and Delirium

In madness, the totality of soul and body is parceled out:
not according to the elements which constitute that totality
metaphysically; but according to figures, images which en-
velop segments of the body and ideas of the soul in a kind
of absurd unity. Fragments which isolate man from him-
self, but above all from reality; fragments which, by de-
taching themselves, have formed the unreal unity of a hal-
lucination, and by very virtue of this autonomy impose it
upon truth, “Madness is no more than the derangement of
the imagination.”* In other words, beginning with passion,
madness is still only an intense movement in the rational
unity of soul and body; this is the level of unreason; but
this intense movement quickly escapes the reason of the
mechanism and becomes, in its violences, its stupors, its
senseless propagations, an irrational movement; and it is
then that, escaping truth and its constraints, the Unreal
appears.

And thereby we find the suggestion of the third cycle
‘we must now trace: that of chimeras, of hallucinations, and
of error—the cycle of non-being.

Ler us listen to what is said in these fantastic fragments.

Imagination is not madness. Even if in the arbi-
trariness of hallucination, alienation finds the first access to
its vain liberty, madness begins only beyond this point,
when the mind binds itself to this arbitrariness and becomes
a prisoner of this apparent liberty. At the moment he wakes
from a dream, a man can indeed observe: “I am imagining
that I am dead”: he thereby. denounces and measures the
arbitrariness of the imagination—he is not mad. He is mad
when he posits as an affirmation of his death--when he
suggests as having some value as truth—the still-neutral
content of the image “I am dead.” And just as the con-
sciousness of truth is not carried away by the mere pres-
ence of the image, but in the act which limits, confronts,

(93)
  

Mavness & CIVILIZATION

unifies, or dissociates the image, so madness will begin only
in the act which gives the value of truth to the image.
There is an original innocence of the imagination: “The
imagination itself does not err, since it neither denies nor
affirms but is fixed to so great a degree on the simple con-
templation of an image”; and only the mind can curn what
is given in the image into abusive truth, in other words, into
error, or acknowledged error, that is, into truth: “A drunk
man thinks he sees two candles where there is but one; a
man who has a strabismus and whose mind is cultivated
immediately acknowledges his error and accustoms himself
to see but one.”?° Madness is thus beyond imagination, and
yet it is profoundly rooted in it; for it consists merely in
allowing the image a spontaneous value, total and absolute
truth. The act of the reasonable man who, rightly or
wrongly, judges an image to be true or false, is beyond this
image, transcends and measures it by what is not itself; the
act of the madman never oversteps the image presented,
but surrenders to its immediacy, and affirms it only insofar
is it is enveloped by it: “Many persons, not to say all, suc-
cumb to madness only from being too concerned about an
object.”"" Inside the image, confiscated by it, and inca-
pable of escaping from it, madness is nonetheless more than
imagination, forming an act of undetermined content.
What is this act? An act of faith, an act of affirmation
and of negation—a discourse which sustains and at the same
time erodes the image, undermines it, distends it in the
course of a reasoning, and organizes it around a segment of
language. The man who imagines he is made of glass is not
mad, for any sleeper can have this image in a dream; but he
is mad if, believing he is made of glass, he thereby con-
cludes that he is fragile, that he is in danger of breaking,
that he must touch no object which might be too resistant,
that he must in fact remain motionless, and so on. Such
reasonings are those of a madman; but again we must note

(94)
  

PREFACE

ing from it its truth as madness, crime, or disease, derives
explicitly from this point. Hence we must speak of that
initial dispute without assuming a victory, or the right to a
victory; we must speak of those actions re-examined in
history, leaving in abeyance all that may figure as a con-
clusion, as a refuge in truth; we shall have to speak of this
act of scission, of this distance set, of this void instituted
between reason and what is not reason, without ever rely-
ing upon the fulfillment of what it claims to be.

Then, and then only, can we determine the realm in
which the man of madness and the man of reason, moving
apart, are not yet disjunct; and in an incipient and very
crude language, antedating that of science, begin the dia-
logue of their breach, testifying in a fugitive way that they
still speak to each other. Here madness and non-madness,
reason and non-reason are inextricably involved: insepa-
rable at the moment when they do not yet exist, and exist-
ing for each other, in relation to each other, in the exchange
which separates them.

In the serene world of mental illness, modern man no
longer communicates with the madman: on one band, the
man of reason delegates the physician to madness, thereby
authorizing a relation only through the abstract universal-
ity of disease; on the other, the man of madness communi-
cates with society only by the intermediary of an equally
abstract reason which is order, physical and moral con-
straint, the anonymous pressure of the group, the require-
ments of conformity. As for a common language, there is
no such thing; or rather, there is no such thing any longer;
the constitution of madness as a:mental illness, at the end of
the eighteenth century, affords the evidence of a broken
dialogue, posits the separation as already effected, and
thrusts into oblivion all those stammered, imperfect words
without fixed syntax in which the exchange between mad-
ness and reason was made. The language of psychiatry,

(x)

that in themselves they are neither absurd nor illogical. On
the contrary, they apply correctly the most rigorous fig-
ures of logic. And Paul Zacchias has no difficulty finding
them, in all their rigor, among the insane. Syllogism, in a
man letting himself starve to death: “The dead do not cat;
I am dead; hence I do not eat.” Induction extended to in-
finiry, in a man suffering from persecution delusions: “A,
B, and C are my enemies; all of them are men; therefore all
men are my enemies.” Enthymeme, in another sufferer:
“Most of those who have lived in this house are dead, hence
I, who have lived in this house, am dead.” The marvelous
logic of the mad which seems to mock that of the logicians
because it resembles it so exactly, or rather because it is
exactly the same, and because at the secret heart of mad~
ness, at the core of so many errors, so many absurdities, so
many words and gestures without consequence, we dis-
cover, finally, the hidden perfection of a language. “From
these things,” Zacchias concludes, “you truly see how best
to discuss the intellect.” The ultimate language of madness
is that of reason, but the language of reason enveloped in
the prestige of the image, limited to the locus of appearance
which the image defines. It forms, outside the totality of
images and the universality of discourse, an abusive, singu-
lar organization whose insistent quality constitutes madness,
Madness, then, is not altogether in the image, which of
itself is neither true nor false, neither reasonable nor mad;
nor is it, further, in the reasoning which is mere form,
revealing nothing but the indubitable figures of logic. And
yet madness is in one and in the other: in a special version
or figure of their relationship.

Let us consider an example borrowed from Diemer-
broek. A man was suffering from a profound melancholia.
As with all melancholics, his mind was attached to a fixed
idea, and this idea was for him the occasion of a constantly
renewed sadness. He accused himself of having killed his

(95)

 
  

Mavness & CIVILIZATION

son, and in the excess of his remorse, declared that God, for
his punishment, had assigned a demon to tempt him, like
the demon which had tempted the Lord. This demon he
saw, spoke to, heard, and answered. He did not understand
why those around him refused to acknowledge such a pres-
ence. Such then is madness: this remorse, this belief, this
hallucination, these speeches; in short, this complex of con-
victions and images which constitutes a delirium. Now
Diemerbroek tries to find out what are the “causes” of this
madness, how it can have originated, And this is what he
learns; this man had taken his son bathing and the boy had
drowned. Hence the father considered himself responsible
for his son’s death. We can therefore reconstitute in the
following manner the development of this madness: judg-
ing himself guilty, the man decides that homicide is execra-
ble in the sight of God on High; whence it occurs to his
imagination that he is eternally damned; and since he
‘knows that the chief torment of damnation consists in be-
ing delivered into Satan’s hands, he tells himself “that a
horrible demon is assigned to him.” This demon he does
not as yet see, but since “the does not cease thinking of it,”
and “regards this notion as necessarily true,” he imposes on
his brain a certain image of this demon; this image is pre-
sented to his soul by the action of the brain and of the
spirits with such insistence that he believes he continually
sees the demon itself,”

Hence madness, as analyzed by Diemerbrock, has two
levels; one is manifest to all eyes: an unwarranted melan-
cholia in a man who wrongly accuses himself of having
killed his son; a depraved imagination which pictures de-
mons; a dismantled reason which converses with a phan-
tom. But at a deeper level, we find a rigorous organization
dependent on the faultless armature of a discourse. This
discourse, in its logic, commands the firmest belief in itself,
it advances by judgments and reasonings which connect

(96)
 Passion and Delirium

together; it is a kind of reason in action. In short, under the
chaotic and manifest delirium reigns the order of a secret
delirium. In this second delirium, which is, in 2 sense, pure
reason, reason delivered of all the external tinsel of demen-
tia, is located the paradoxical truth of madness. And this in
a double sense, since we find here both what makes mad-
ness true (irrefutable logic, perfectly organized discourse,
faultless connection in the transparency of a virtual lan-
guage) and what makes it truly madness (its own nature,
the special style of all its manifestations, and the internal
structure of delirium).

But still more profoundly, this delirious language is the
ultimate truth of madness insofar as it is madness’s organiz-
ing form, the determining principle of all its manifestations,
whether of the body or of the soul. For if Diemerbroek’s
melancholic converses with his demon, it is because the de-
mon’s image has been profoundly impressed by the move-
ment of spirits on the still-ductle substance of the brain.
But in its turn, this organic figure is merely the other side of
a preoccupation which has obsessed the patient’s mind; it
represents what might be called the sedimentation in the
body of an infinitely repeated discourse apropos of the
punishment God must reserve for sinners guilty of homi-
cide. The body and the traces it conceals, the soul and the
images it perceives, are here no more than stages in the
syntax of delirious language.

And lest we be criticized for elaborating this entire anal-
ysis around a single observation from a single author (a
privileged observation, since it concerns melancholic delir-
ium), we shall also seek confirmation of the fundamental
role of delirious discourse in the classical conception of
madness in another author, of another period, and apropos
of a very different disease. This is a case of “nympho-
mania” observed by Bienville. The imagination of a young
girl, “Julie,” had been inflamed by precocious reading and

(97)

 
  

Mavness & CIVILIZATION

aroused by the remarks of a servant girl “initiated into the
secrets of Venus, . . . a virtuous handmaiden in the moth-
er’s eyes” but “a dear and voluptuous stewardess of the
daughter’s pleasures.” Yet Julie combats these—to her—
new desires with all the impressions she has received in the
course of her education; to the seductive language of nov-
els, she opposes the lessons of religion and virtue; and de-
spite the vivacity of her imagination, she does not succumb
to disease so long as she possesses “the strength to reason
thus with herself; it is neither lawful nor virtuous to obey
so shameful a passion.”!* But the wicked remarks, the dan-
gerous readings increase; at every moment, they render
more intense the agitation of the weakening fibers; then the
fundamental language by which she had hitherto resisted
gradually gives way: “Nature alone had spoken hitherto;
but soon illusion, chimera, and extravagance played their
part; at length she acquired the unhappy strength to ap-
prove in herself this horrible maxim: nothing is so beautiful
nor so sweet as to obey the desires of love.” This funda-
mental discourse opens the gates of madness: the imagina~
tion is freed, the appetites continually increase, the fibers
reach the final degree of irritation, Delirium, in its lapidary
form of a moral principle, leads straight to the convulsions
which can endanger life itself.

At the end of this last cycle which had begun with the
liberty of the hallucination and which closes now with the
rigor of delirious language, we can conclude:

1. inmadness, for the classical age, there exist two forms
of delirium. A special, symptomatic form, proper to some
of the diseases of the mind and especially to melancholia; in
this sense we can say that there are diseases with or without
delirium. In any case, such delirium is always manifest; it
forms an integral part of the signs of madness; it is imma-
nent to madness’s truth and constitutes only @ sector of it.
But there exists another delirium which is not always mani-

(98)
  

 

Passion and Delirium

fest, which is not formulated by the sufferer himself in the
course of the disease, but which cannot fail to exist in the
eyes of anyone who, seeking to trace the disease from its
origins, attempts to formulate its riddle and its truth.

2. This implicit delirium exists in all the alterations of
the mind, even where we would expect it least. In cases of
no more than silent gestures, wordless violence, oddities of
conduct, classical thought has no doubt that madness is
continually subjacent, relating each of these particular signs
to the general essence of madness. James’s Dictionary ex-
pressly urges us to consider as delirious “the sufferers who
sin by fault or excess in any of various voluntary actions, in
@ manner contrary to reason and to propriety; as when
they use their hand, for example, to tear out tufts of wool
or in an action similar to that which serves to catch flies; or
when a patient acts against his custom and without cause,
or when he speaks too much or too little against his normal
habits; if he abounds in obscene remarks, being, when in
health, of measured speech and decent in his discourse, and
if he utters words that have no consequence, if he breathes
more faintly than he must, or uncovers his private parts in
the presence of those who are near him. We also regard as
being in a state of delirium those whose minds are affected
by some derangement in the organs of sense, or who use
them in a fashion not customary to them, as when, for
example, a sufferer is deprived of some voluntary action or
acts inhabitually.”"*

3. Thus understood, discourse covers the entire range
of madness. Madness, in the classical sense, does not desig-
nate so much a specific change in the mind or in the body,
as the existence, under the body’s alterations, under the
oddity of conduct and conversation, of a delirious dis-
course, The simplest and most general definition we can
give of classical madness is indeed delirium: “This word is
_ derived from lira, a furrow; so that deliro actually means to

(99)

 
  

Mavness & CIVILIZATION

move out of the furrow, away from the proper path of
reason.”** Hence it is not surprising to find the eighteenth-
century nosographers often classifying vertigo as a mad-
ness, and more rarely hysterical convulsions; this is because
it is often impossible to find in hysterical convulsions the
unity of a language, while vertigo affords the delirious
affirmation. that the world is really “turning around.” Such
delirium is a necessary and sufficient reason for a disease to
be called madness. .

4. Language is the first and last structure of madness,
its constituent form; on language are based all the cycles in
which madness articulates its nature. That the essence of
madness can be ultimately defined in the simple structure of
a discourse does not reduce it to a purely psychological
nature, but gives it a hold over the totality of soul and
body; such discourse is both the silent language by which
the mind speaks to itself in the truth proper to it, and the
visible articulation in the movements of the body, Parallel-
isms, complements, all the forms of immediate communica-
tion which we have seen manifested, in madness are sus-
pended between soul and body in this single language and
in its powers, The movement of passion which persists until
it breaks and turns against itself, the sudden appearance of
the image, and the agitations of the body which were its
visible concomitants—all this, even as we were trying to
reconstruct it, was already secretly animated by this lan-
guage. If the determinism of passion is transcended and
released in the hallucination of the image, if the image, in“
return, has swept away the whole world of beliefs and de-
sires, it is because the delirious language was already pres-
ent—a discourse which liberated passion from all its limits,
and adhered with all the constraining weight of its affirma-
tion to the image which was liberating itself.

It is in this delirium, which is of both body and soul, of
both language and image, of both grammar and physiol-

(100)
 Passion and Delirium

ogy, that all the cycles of madness conclude and begin. It is
this delirium whose rigorous meaning organized them from
the start. It is madness itself, and also, beyond each of its
phenomena, its silent transcendence, which constitute the
truth of madness.

A last question remains: In the name of what can this
fundamental language be regarded as a delirium? Granting
thar it is the truth of madness, what makes it true madness
and the originating form of insanity? Why should it be in
this discourse, whose forms we have seen to be so faithful
to the rules of reason, that we find all those signs which will
most manifestly declare the very absence of reason?

A central question, but one to which the classical age has
not formulated a direct answer. We must approach it
obliquely, interrogating the experiences which are to be
found in the immediate neighborhood of this essential lan-
guage of madness: that is, the dream and the delusion.

The quasi-oneiric character of madness is one of the con-
stant themes in the classical period. A theme which doubt-
less derives from a very old tradition, to which André du
Laurens, at the end of the sixteenth century, still testifies;
for him melancholia and dreams have the same origin and
bear, in relation to truth, the same value. There are “natu-
ral dreams” which represent what, during the preceding
day, has passed through the senses or the understanding but
happens to be modified by the specific temperament of the
subject. In the same way, there is a melancholia which has a
merely physical origin in the disposition of the sufferer and
alters, for his mind, the importance, the value, and so to
speak the coloration of real events. But there is also a
melancholia which permits the sufferer to predict the future,
to speak in an unknown language, to see beings ordinarily
invisible; this melancholia originates in a supernatural inter-
vention, the same which brings to the sleeper’s mind those

(707)

 

 
  

MADNESS & CIVILIZATION

dreams which foresee the future, announce events to come,
and cause him to see “strange things.”

But in fact the seventeenth century preserves this tradi-
tion of the resemblance between madness and dreams only
to break it all the more completely and to generate new,
more essential relations, Relations in which madness and
dreams are not only understood in their remote origin or
in their imminent value as signs, but are confronted as
phenomena, in their development, in their very nature.

Dreams and madness then appeared to be of the same
substance. Their mechanism was the same; thus Zacchias
could identify in sleepwalking the movements which cause
dreams, but which in a waking state can also provoke
madness.

In the first moments when one falls asleep, the vapors
which rise in the body and ascend to the head are many,
turbulent, and dense. They are so dark that they waken no
image in the brain; they merely agitate, in their chaotic
dance, the nerves and the muscles. The same is true in the
frenzied, in maniacs: they suffer few hallucinations, no
false beliefs, but an intense agitation which they cannot
manage to control, Let us continue the evolution of sleep:
after the first period of turbulence, the vapors which rise to
the brain are clarified, their movement organized; this is the
moment when fantastic dreams are born; one sees miracles,
a thousand impossible things. To this stage corresponds that
of dementia, in which one is convinced of many things
“which are not in real life.” Then at last the agitation of the
vapors is calmed altogether; the sleeper begins to see things
still more clearly; in the transparency of the henceforth -
limpid vapors, recollections of the day before reappear in
accordance with reality; such images are at most trans-
posed, on one point or another—as occurs in melancholics,
who recognize all things as they are, “in particular those
who are not merely distracted.” Between the gradual de-

(102)
 Passion and Delirium

velopments of sleep—with what they contribute at each
stage to the quality of the imagination—and the forms of
madness, the analogy is constant, because the mechanisms
are the same: the sare movement of vapors and spirits, the
same liberation of images, the same correspondence be-
tween the physical qualities of phenomena and the psycho-
logical or moral values of sentiments. “To emerge from the
insane no differently than from the sleeping.”**

The important thing, in Zacchias’s analysis, is that mad-
ness is not associated with dreams in their positive phe-
nomena, but rather to the totality formed by sleep and
dreams together: that is, to a complex which includes—be-
sides the image—hallucination, memory, or prediction, the
great void of sleep, the night of the senses, and all that
negativity which wrests man from the waking state and its
apparent truths. Whereas tradition compared the delirium
of the madman to the vivacity of the dream images, the
classical period identified delirium only with the complex
of the image and the night of the mind, against which back-
ground it assumed its liberty. And this complex, transposed
entire into the clarity of the waking state, constituted mad-
ness, This is how we must understand the definitions of
madness which insistently recur throughout the classical
period. The dream, as a complex figure of image and sleep,
1s almost always present in that definition, Either in a nega~
tive fashion—the notion of the waking state then being the
only one that distinguishes madmen from sleepers; or in a
positive fashion, delirium being defined as a modality of the
dream, with the waking state as the specific difference:
“Delirium is the dream of waking persons.”’” The an-
cients’ notion of the dream as a transitory form of madness
is inverted; it is no longer the dream which borrows its
disturbing powers from alienation—showing thereby how
fragile or limited reason is; it is madness which takes its
original nature from the dream and reveals in this kinship

(103)

 
  

MavNeEss & CIVILIZATION

that it is a liberation of the image in the dark night of
reality.

The dream deceives; it leads to confusions; it is illusory.
But it is not erroneous. And that is why madness is not
exhausted in the waking modality of the dream, and why it
overflows into error, It is true that in the dream, the imag-
ination forges “impossible things and miracles,” or that it
assembles lifelike figures “by an irrational method”; but,
Zacchias remarks, “there is no error in these things, and
consequently nothing insane.” Madness occurs when the
images, which are so close to the dream, receive the affirma-
tion or negation that constitutes error. It is in this sense that
the Encyclopédie proposed its famous definition of mad-
ness: to depart from reason “with confidence and in the
firm conviction that one is following it—that, it seems to
me, is what is called being mad.” Error is the other element
always present with the dream, in the classical definition of
insanity. The madman, in the seventeenth and eighteenth
centunes, is not so much the victim of an illusion, of 2
hallucination of his senses, or of a movement of his mind.
He is not abused; he deceives himself. If it is true that on
one hand the madman’s mind is led on by the oneiric arbi-
trariness of images, on the other, and at the same time, he
imprisons himself in the circle of an erroneous conscious-
ness; “We call madmen,” Sauvages was to say, “those who
are actually deprived of reason or who persist in some no-
table error; it is this constant error of the soul manifest in
its imagination, in its judgments, and in its desires, which
constitutes the characteristic of this category.”

Madness begins where the relation of man to truth is
disturbed and darkened. It is in this relation, at the same
time as in the destruction of this relation, that madness as-
sumes its general meaning and its particular forms. Demen-
tia, Zacchias says, using the term here in the most general
sense of madness, “lay in this, that the intellect did not

 Preface

which is a monologue of reason about madness, has been
established only on the basis of such a silence,

I have not tried to write the history of that language, but
rather the archaeology of that silence.

The Greeks had a relation to something that they called
‘Bow. This relation was not merely one of condemnation;
the existence of Thrasymachus or of Callicles suffices to
prove it, even if their language has reached us already en-
veloped in the reassuring dialectic of Socrates. But the
Greek Logos bad no contrary.

European man, since the beginning of the Middle Ages,
has had a relation to something he calls, indiscriminately,
Madness, Dementia, Insanity. Perhaps it is to this obscure
presence that Western reason owes something of its depth,
as the owpooovvy of the Socratic reasoners owes something
to the threat of tBos. In any case, the Reason-Madness
nexus constitutes for Western culture one of the dimen-
sions of its originality; it already accompanied that culture
long before Hieronymus Bosch, and will follow it long
after Nietzsche and Artaud. /

What, then, is this confrontation beneath the language of
reason? Where can an interrogation lead us which does not
follow reason in its horizontal course, but seeks to retrace
in time that constant verticality which confronts European
culture with what it is not, establishes its range by its own
derangement? What realm do we enter which is neither the
history of knowledge, nor history itself; which is con-
trolled by neither the teleology of truth nor the rational
sequence of causes, since causes have value and meaning
only beyond the division? A realm, no doubt, where what
is in question is the limits rather than the identity of a
culture.

The classical period—from Willis to Pinel, from the
frenzies of Racine’s Oreste to Sade’s Juliette and the Quinta

(27)

 
  

Passion and Delirium

distinguish true from false.” But this breakdown, if we can
understand it only as negation, has positive structures
which give it singular forms. According to the different
forms of access to the truth, there will be different types of
madness, It is in this sense that Chrichton, for example,
distinguishes in the order of vesanias, first the class deliria,
which alter that relation to the truth which takes shape in
perception (“general delirium of the mental faculties, in
which the diseased perceptions are taken for realities”);
then the class hallucinations, which alter representation
(“error of the mind in which imaginary objects are taken
for realities, or else real objects are falsely represented”);
and last, the class dementias, which without abolishing or
altering the faculties that afford access to truch, weaken
them and diminish their powers.

But we can also analyze madness starting with truth itself
and with the forms proper to it, It is in this manner that the
Encyclopédie distinguishes “physical truth” from “moral
truth.” “Physical truth consists in the accurate relation of
our sensations with physical objects”; there will be a form
of madness determined by the impossibility of acceding to
this form of truth; a kind of madness of the physical world
which includes illusions, hallucinations, all perceptual dis-
turbances; “it is a madness to hear choirs of angels, as cer-
tain enthusiasts do.” “Moral truth,” on the other hand,
“consists in the exactitude of the relations we discern either
between moral objects, or between those objects and our-
selves.” There will be a form of madness consisting of the
loss of these relations; such is the madness of character, of
conduct, and of the passions. “Veritable madnesses, then,
are all the derangements of our mind, all the illusions of self-
love, and all our passions when they are carried to the point
of blindness; for blindness is the distinctive characteristic of
madness,”?6

Blindness: one of the words which comes closest to the

(205)

 
  

MavNESS & CIVILIZATION

essence of classical madness, It refers to that night of quasi-
sleep which surrounds the images of madness, giving them,
in their solitude, an invisible sovereignty; but it refers also
to ill-founded beliefs, mistaken judgments, to that whole
background of errors inseparable from madness. The fun-
damental discourse of delirium, in its constitutive powers,
thus reveals to what extent, despite analogies of form, de-
spite the rigor of its meaning, it was not a discourse of
reason. It spoke, but in the night of blindness; it was more -
than the loose and disordered text of a dream, since it de-
ceived itself; but it was more than an erroneous proposi-
tion, since it was plunged into that total obscurity which is
that of sleep. Delirium, as the principle of madness, is a
system of false propositions in the general syntax of the
dream.

Madness is precisely at the point of contact becween the
oneiric and the erroneous; it traverses, in its variations, the
surface on which they meet, the surface which both joins
and separates them. With error, madness shares non-truth,
and arbitrariness in affirmation or negation, from the
dream, madness borrows the flow of images and the color-
ful presence of hallucinations. But while error is merely
non-truth, while the dream neither affirms nor judges, mad-
ness fills the void of error with images, and links hallucina~
tions by affirmation of the false. In a sense, it is thus pleni-
tude, joining to the figures of night the powers of day, to
the forms of fantasy the activity of the waking mind, it
links the dark content with the forms of light. But is noc
such plenitude actually the cubnination of the void? The
presence of images offers no more than night-ringed hallu-
cinations, figures inscribed at the corners of sleep, hence
detached from any sensuous reality; however vivid they
are, however rigorously established in the body, these
images are nothingness, since they represent nothing; as for

(106)
 Passion and Delirium

erroneous judgment, it judges only in appearance: affirm-
ing nothing true or real, it does not affirm at all; it is en-
snared in the non-being of error.

Joining vision and blindness, image and judgment, hal-
lucination and language, sleep and waking, day and night,
madness is ultimately nothing, for it unites in them all that
is negative. But the paradox of this nothing is to manifest
itself, to explode in signs, in words, in gestures. Inextricable
unity of order and disorder, of the reasonable being of
things and this nothingness of madness! For madness, if it is
nothing, can manifest itself only by departing from itself,
by assuming an appearance in the order of reason and thus
becoming the contrary of itself, Which illuminates the
paradoxes of the classical experience: madness is always ab~
sent, in a perpetual retreat where it is inaccessible, without
phenomenal or positive character; and yet it is present and
perfectly visible in the singular evidence of the madman.
Meaningless disorder as madness is, it reveals, when we ex-
amine it, only ordered classifications, rigorous mechanisms
in soul and body, language articulated according to a vis-
ible logic. All that madness can say of itself is merely rea-
son, though it is itself the negation of reason. In short, @
rational hold over madness is always possible and necessary,
to the very degree that madness is non-reason.

There is only one word which summarizes this experi-
ence, Unreason: all that, for reason, is closest and most
remote, emptiest and most complete; all that presents itself
to reason in familiar structures—authorizing a knowledge,
and then a science, which seeks to be positive—and all that
is constantly in retreat from reason, in the inaccessible do-
main of nothingness.

And if, now, we try to assign @ value, in and of itself,
outside its relations with the dream and with error, to clas-

(107)

 
  

Mavness & CIVILIZATION

sical unreason, we must understand it not as reason dis-
eased, or as reason lost or alienated, but quite simply as
reason dazzled.

Dazzlement is night in broad daylight, the darkness that
rules at the very heart of what is excessive in light’s radi-
ance. Dazzled reason opens its eyes upon the sun and sees
nothing, that is, does not see; in dazzlement, the recession
of objects toward the depths of night has as an immediate
correlative the suppression of vision itself; at the moment
when it sees objects disappear into the secret night of light,
sight sees itself in the moment of its disappearance.

To say that madness is dazzlement is to say that the mad-
man sees the daylight, the same daylight as the man of
reason (both live in the same brightness); but seeing this
same daylight, and nothing but this daylight and nothing in
it, he sees it as void, as night, as nothing; for him the
shadows are the way to perceive daylight. Which means
that, seeing the night and the nothingness of the night, he
does not see at all. And believing he sees, he admits as reali-
ties the hallucinations of his imagination and all the multi-
tudinous population of night, That is why delirium and
dazzlement are in a relation which constitutes the essence of
madness, exactly as truth and light, in their fundamental
relation, constitute classical reason.

In this sense, the Cartesian formula of doubt is certainly
the great exorcism of madness. Descartes closes his eyes and
plugs up his ears the better to see the crue brightness of
essential daylight; thus he is secured against the dazzlement
of the madman who, opening his eyes, sees only night, and
not seeing at all, believes he sees when he imagines. In the
uniform lucidity of his closed senses, Descartes has broken
with all possible fascination, and if he sees, he is certain of
seeing that which he sees. While before the eyes of the
madman, drunk on a light which is darkness, rise and multi-

(108)
 Passion and Delirium

ply images incapable of criticizing themselves (since the
madman sees them), but irreparably separated from being
(since the madman sees nothing).

Unreason is in the same relation to reason as dazzlement
to the brightness of daylight itself. And this is not a meta-
phor. We are at the center of the great cosmology which
animates all classical culture. The “cosmos” of the Renais-
sance, so rich in internal communications and symbolisms,
entirely dominated by the interacting presence of the stars,
has now disappeared, without “nature” having yet assumed
its status of universality, without its having received man’s
lyrical recognition, subjecting him to the rhythm of its sea-
sons, What the classical thinkers retain of the “world,”
what they already anticipate in “nature,” is an extremely
abstract law, which ‘nonetheless forms the most vivid and
concrete opposition, that of day and night. This is no
longer the fatal time of the planets, it is not yet the lytical
time of the seasons; it is the universal but absolutely divided
ume of brightness and darkness. A form which thought
entirely masters in a mathematical science—Cartesian phys-
ics is a kind of mathesis of light~but which at the same
time traces the great tragic caesura in human existence: one
that dominates the theatrical time of Racine and the space
of Georges de la Tour in the same imperious fashion. The
circle of day and night is the law of che classical world: the
most reduced but the most demanding of the world’s neces-
sities, the most inevitable but the simplest of nature’s legali-
ties,

A law which excludes all dialectic and all reconciliation;
which establishes, consequently, both the flawless unity of
knowledge and the uncompromising division of tragic ex-
istence; it rules over a world without ewilight, which
knows no effusion, nor the attenuated cares of lyricism;
everything must be either waking or dream, truth or dark-

(109)

 
  

Mavness & CIVILIZATION

ness, the light of being or the nothingness of shadow. Such
a law prescribes an inevitable order, 2 serene division which
makes truth possible and confirms it forever.

And yet on either side of this order, two symmetrical,
inverse figures bear witness that there are extremities where
it can be transgressed, showing at the same time to what
degree it is essential not to transgress it. On one side, trag-
edy. The rule of the theatrical day has a positive content; it
forces tragic duration to be poised upon the singular but
universal alternation of day and night; the whole of the
tragedy must be accomplished in this unity of time, for
tragedy is ultimately nothing but the confrontation of two
realms, linked to each other by time itself, in the irrecon-
cilable. Every day, in Racine’s theater, is overhung by 2
night, which it brings, so to speak, to light: the night of ©
Troy and its massacres, the night of Nero’s desires, Titus’s
Roman night, Athalie’s night. These are the great stretches
of night, realms of darkness which haunt the day without
yielding an hour, and disappear only in the new night of
death, And these fantastic nights, in their turn, are haunted
by a light which forms a kind of infernal reflection of the
day: the burning of Troy, the torches of the Praetorians.
the pale light of the dream. In classical tragedy, day and
night are arranged like 2 pair of mirrors, endlessly reflect
each other, and afford that simple couple a sudden pro-
fundity which envelops in a single movement all of man’s
life and his death. In the same fashion, in De la Tour’s
Madeleine au miroir, light and shadow confront each other
divide and at the same time unite a face and its reflection, <
skull and its image, a vigil and a silence; and in the Jomage
Saint-Alexis, the page holding the torch reveals under the
shadow of the vault the man who was his master—a grave
and luminous boy encounters all of human misery; a chilc
brings death to light.

On the other side, facing tragedy and its hieratic lan.

(ri0)
 Passion and Delirium

guage, is the confused murmur of madness. Here, too, the
great law of the division has been violated; shadow and
light mingle in the fury of madness, as in the tragic dis-
order. But in another mode. In night, the tragic character
found a somber truth of day; the night of Troy remained
Andromache’s truth, as Athalie’s night presaged the truth
of the already advancing day; night, paradoxically, revealed;
it was the profoundest day of being. The madman, con-
versely, finds in daylight only the inconsistency of the
night’s figures; he lets the light be darkened by all the illu-
sions of the dream; his day is only the most superficial
night of appearance, It is to this degree that tragic man,
more than any other, is engaged in being, is the bearer of
his truth, since, like Phédre, he flings in the face of the pit-
less sun all the secrets of the night; while the madman is
entirely excluded from being. And how could he not be,
lending as he does the day’s illusory reflection to the night’s
non-being? ,

We understand that the tragic hero—in contrast to the
baroque character of the preceding period—can never be
mad; and that conversely madness cannot bear within itself
those values of tragedy, which we have known since Nietz-
sche and Artaud. In the classical period, the man of tragedy
and the man of madness confront each other, without 2
possible dialogue, without a common language; for the
former can utter only the decisive words of being, uniting
in a flash the truth of light and the depth of darkness; the
latter endlessly drones out the indifferent murmur which
cancels out both the day’s chatter and the lying dark.

Madness designates the equinox between the vanity of
night’s hallucinations and the non-being of light’s judg-
ments.

And this much, which the archaeology of knowledge has
been able to teach us bit by bit, was already offered to us in

(raz)

 

 
  

Mavness & CIVILIZATION

a simple tragic fulguration, in the last words of Andro-
maque.

As if, at che moment when madness was vanishing from
the tragic act, at the moment when tragic man was to sepa-
rate himself for over two centuries from the man of un-
Teason~-as if, at this very moment, an ultimate figuration
were demanded of madness. The curtain which falls on the
last scene of Andromaque also falls on the last of the great
tragic incarnations of madness. But in this presence on the
threshold of its own disappearance, in this madness incar-
cerating itself for good, is articulated what it is and will be
for the entire classical age. Is it not precisely at the moment
of its disappearance that it can best present its truth, its
truth of absence, its trath which is that of day at the limits
of night? This had to be the Jast scene of the first great
classical tragedy; or if one prefers, the first time in which
the classical truth of madness is expressed in a tragic move-
ment which is the /ast of the preclassical theater. A truth, in
any case, that.is instantaneous, since its appearance can only
be its disappearance; the lightning-flash is seen only in the
already advancing night.

Orestes, in his frenzy, passes through a triple circle of
night: three concentric figurations of dazzlement. Day has
just dawned over Pyrrhus’s palace; night is still there, edg-
ing this light with shadow, and peremptorily indicating it:
Limit. On this morning which is a festival morning, the
crime has been committed, and Pyrrhus has closed his eyes
on the dawning day: a fragment of shadow cast here on
the steps of the alrar, on the threshold of brightness and of
darkness. The rwo great cosmic themes of madness are thus
present in various forms, as omen, decor, and counterpoint
of Orestes’ frenzy.’ It can then begin: in a pitiless clarity
which denounces the murder of Pyrrhus and the treachery
of Hermione, in that dawn where everything finally ex.
plodes in a truth so old and at the same time so young, «

(212)
  

 

Passion and Delirium

first circle of shadow: a dark cloud into which, all around
Orestes, the world begins to withdraw, the truth appears in
this paradoxical twilight, in this matinal night where the
cruelty of truth will be transformed into the fury of hal-
lucination:

Mais quelle épaisse nuit, tout a coup, m’environne?

(But what thick night suddenly surrounds me?)

Trt is the empty night of error; but against the back-
ground of this first obscurity, a brilliance, a false light will
appear: that of images. The nightmare rises, not in the
bright light of morning, but in a somber scintillation: the
light of storm and of murder.

Dieux! quels ruisseaux de sang coulent autour de moi!
(O Gods! What streams of blood flow around me!)

And then appears the dynasty of the dream. In this night
the hallucinations are set free; the Erinnyes appear and take
over. What makes them precarious also makes them sov-
ereign; they triumph easily in the solitude where they suc-
ceed one another; nothing challenges them; images and lan-
guage intersect, in apostrophes which are invocations,
presences affirmed and repulsed, solicited and feared. But
all these ‘images converge toward night, toward a second
night which is that of punishment, of eternal vengeance, of
death within death. The Erinnyes are recalled to that dark-
ness which is their own—their birthplace and their truth,
ie. their own nothingness,

Venez-vous mienlever dans Péternelle nuit?
(Do you come to bear me off into eternal night?)

This is the moment when it is revealed that the images of
madness are only dream and error, and if the sufferer who
is blinded by them appeals to them, it is only to disappear
with them in the annihilation to which they are fated.

A second time, then, we pass through a circle of night.
But we are not thereby restored to the daylight reality of

(223)

 

 
  

Mavness & CIVILIZATION

the world. We accede, beyond what is manifested in mad-
ness, to delirium, to that essential and constitutive structure
which had secretly sustained madness from the first. This
delirium has a name, Hermione; Hermione who no longer
reappears as a hallucinatory vision, but as the ultimate truth
of madness. It is significant that Hermione intervenes at this
very moment of the frenzy: not among the Eumenides, nor
ahead of them—to guide them; but behind and separated
from them by the night into which they have dragged
Orestes and in which they themselves are now scattered.
Hermione intervenes as a figure of delirium, as the truth
which secretly reigned from the start, and of which the
Eumenides were ultimately only the servants. Here we
are at the opposite of Greek tragedy, where the Erinnyes
were the final destiny and truth which, in the night of time,
had awaited the hero; his passion was merely their instru-
ment. Here the Eumenides are merely figures in the service
of delirium, the primary and ultimate truth, which was al-
ready appearing in passion, and now declares itself in its
nakedness. This truth rules alone, thrusting images away:
Mais non, retirez-vous, laissez faire Hermione.
(But no, begone, Jet Hermione do her work.)

Hermione, who has always been present from the begin-
ning, Hermione who has always lacerated Orestes, destroy-
ing his reason bit by bit, Hermione for whom he has
become “parricide, assassin, sacrilége,” reveals herself fi-
nally as the truth and culmination of his madness. And
delirium, in its rigor, no longer has anything to say except
to articulate as imminent decision a truth long since com-
monplace and laughable:

Et je lui porte enfin mon coeur a dévorer.
(And I bring her at last my heart to devour.)

Days and years ago Orestes had offered up this savage

sacrifice. But now he expresses this principle of his madness

the exchange between madness and reason modifies its lan-
guage, and in a radical manner. In the history of madness,
two events indicate this change with a singular clarity:
1657, the creation of the Hépital Général and the “great
confinement” of the poor; 1794, the liberation of the
chained inmates of Bicétre. Between these two unique and
symmetrical events, something happens whose ambiguity
bas left the historians of medicine at a loss: blind repression
in an absolutist regime, according to some; but according to
others, the gradual discovery by science and philanthropy
of madness in its positive truth. As a matter of fact, beneath
these reversible meanings, a structure is forming which
does not resolve the ambiguity but determines it, It is this
structure which accounts for the transition from the me-
dieval and humanist experience of madness to our own ex-
perience, which confines insanity within mental illness. In
the Middle Ages and until the Renaissance, man’s dispute
with madness was a dramatic debate in which be con-
fronted the secret powers of the world; the experience of
madness was clouded by images of the Fall and the Will of
God, of the Beast and the Metamorphosis, and of all the
marvelous secrets of Knowledge. In our era, the experience
of madness remains silent in the composure of a knowledge
which, knowing too much about madness, forgets it. But
from one of these experiences to the other, the shift bas
been made by a world without images, without positive
character, in a kind of silent transparency which reveals—
as mute institution, act without commentary, immediate
knowledge—a great motionless structure; this structure is
one of neither drama nor knowledge; it is the point where
history is immobilized in the tragic category which both
establishes and impugns it.

as an end. For madness cannot go any farther. Having ut-
tered its truth in its essential delirium, it can do no more
than collapse in a third night, that night from which there
is no return, the night of an incessant devouring. Unreason
can appear only for a moment, the instant when language
enters silence, when delirium itself is stilled, when the heart
is at last devoured.

In the tragedies of the early seventeenth century, mad-
ness, too, released drama; but it did so by liberating truth;
madness still had access to language, to a renewed language
of explanation and of reality reconquered, It could be at
most only the penultimate moment of the tragedy. Not the
last, as in Andromaque, in which no truth is uttered except
the truth, in delirium, of a passion which has found with
madness the perfection of its fulfillmenc.

The movement proper to unreason, which classical learn-
ing followed and pursued, had already accomplished the
whole of its trajectory in the concision of tragic language.
After which, silence could reign, and madness disappear in
the—always withdrawn—presence of unreason.

What we now know of unreason affords us a better un-
derstanding of what confinement was.

This gesture, which banished madness to a neutral and
uniform world of exclusion, did not mark a halt in the
evolution of medical techniques, nor in the progress of
humanitarian ideas. It assumed its precise meaning in this
fact: that madness in the classical period ceased to be the
sign of another world, and that it became the paradoxical
manifestation of non-being. Ultimately, confinement did
seek to suppress madness, to eliminate from the social order
a figure which did not find its place within it; the essence of
confinement was not the exorcism of a danger. Confine-
ment merely manifested what madness, in its essence, was:
a manifestation of non-being; and by providing this man-

(tis)

ifestation, confinement thereby suppressed it, since it re-
stored it to its truth as nothingness, Confinement is the
practice which corresponds most exactly to madness ex-
perienced as unreason, that is, as the empty negativity of
reason; by confinement, madness is acknowledged to be
nothing. ‘That is, on one hand madness is immediately per-
ceived as difference: whence the forms of spontaneous and
collective judgment sought, not from physicians, but from
men of good sense, to determine the confinement of a mad-
man, and on the other hand, confinement cannot have any
other goal than a correction (that is, the suppression of the
difference, or the fulfillment of this nothingness in death);
whence those options for death so often to be found in the
registers of confinement, written by the attendants, and
which are not the sign of confinement’s savagery, its in-
humanity or perversion, but the strict expression of its
meaning: an operation to annihilate nothingness.” Con-
finement sketches, on the surface of phenomena and in a
hasty moral synthesis, the secret and distinct structure of
madness,

Then did confinement establish its practices in this
profound intuition? Was it because madness under the
effect of confinement had really vanished from the classical
horizon that it was ultimately stigmatized as non-being?
Questions whose answers refer to each other in a perfect
circularity. It is futile, no doubt, to lose oneself in the end-
less cycle of these forms of interrogation. Better to let clas-
sical culture formulate, in its general structure, the experi-
ence it had of madness, an experience which crops up with
the same meanings, in the identical order of its inner logic,
in both the order of speculation and the order of institu-
tions, in both discourse and decree, in both word and
watchword—wherever, in fact, a signifying element can
assume for us the value of a language.

ASPECTS OF ACADNESS

In this chapter we do not wish to write a history of the
different notions of psychiatry in the seventeenth and eigh-
teenth centuries, but rather to show the specific faces by
which madness was recognized in classical thought. Faces
still haunted by mythical figures, but which have often
been essential in the organization of our practical knowl-

edge.
1. Mania and Melancholia

The notion of melancholia was fixed, in the sixteenth cen-
tury, between a certain definition by symptoms and an
explanatory principle concealed in the very term that des-
ignated it. Among the symptoms, we find all the delirious
ideas an individual can form about himself: “Some think
themselves to be beasts, whose voice and actions they imi-
tate. Some think that they are vessels of glass, and for this
reason recoil from passers-by, lest they break; others fear

(717)

 
 MADNESS & CIVILIZATION

death, which they yet cause most often to themselves. Still
others imagine that they are guilty of some crime, so that
they tremble with terror when they see another coming
toward them, thinking he seeks to take them prisoner and
sentence them to death.”! Delirious themes that remain iso-
lated and do not compromise reason’s totality. Thomas
Sydenham would even observe that melancholics “are
people who, apart from their complaint, are prudent and
sensible, and who have an extraordinary penetration and
sagacity, Thus Aristotle rightly observed that melancholics
have more intelligence than other men.”

Now this clear and coherent syndrome was designated
by a word that implied an entire causal system, that of
melancholia: “I beg you to regard closely the thoughts of
melancholics, their words, visions, actions, and you will dis-
cover how all their senses are depraved by a melancholic
humor spread through their brain.”? Partial delirium and
the action of black bile were juxtaposed in the notion of
melancholia, unrelated for the moment beyond 2 disjunct
confrontation of a group of signs by a signifying name. Yet
in the eighteenth century a unity would be found, or rather
an exchange would be made—the nature of that cold, black
humor having become the major coloration of delirium, its
positive value in contrast to mania, dementia, and frenzy,
its essential principle of cohesion. And while Hermann
Boerhaave still defined melancholia as merely “‘a long, per-
sistent delirium without fever, during which the sufferer is
obsessed by only one thought,” Dufour, several years later,
shifted the weight of his definition to “fear and sadness,”
which were now supposed to explain the partial character
of the delirium: “Hence it is that melancholics love solitude
and shun company; this makes them more attached to the
object of their delirium or to their dominant passion, what~
ever it may be, while they seem indifferent to anything
else.” The concept is fixed not by a new rigor in observa-

(778)

 
 Aspects of Madness

tion, nor by a discovery in the realm of causes, but by a
qualitative transmission proceeding from a cause implied in
the designation to a significant perception in the effects.

For a long time—until the beginning of the seventeenth
century--the discussion of melancholia remained fixed
within the tradition of the four humors and their essential
qualities: stable qualities actually inherent in a substance,
which alone could be considered as their cause. For Jean
Fernel, the melancholic humor, related to earth and to au-
tamn, is a juice “thick in consistency, cold and dry in tem-
perament.” But in the first half of the century, a debate
began over the origin of melancholia: must one necessarily
have a melancholic temperament to be afflicted with melan-
cholia? Is the melancholic humor always cold and dry—is
it never warm, or humid? Is it the substance which acts, or
the qualities which are transmitted? The results of this
long debate may be summarized as follows:

1. The causality of substances is increasingly replaced
by a movement of qualities, which, without any vehicular
means, are immediately transmitted from body to soul,
from humor to ideas, from organs to conduct. Thus, for
Duncan’s Apologist the best proof that the melancholic
juice produces melancholia is that in it one finds the very
qualities of the disease: “The melancholic juice possesses to
a far greater degree the conditions necessary to produce
melancholia than your fiery angers; since by its coldness, it
diminishes the quantity of spirits; by its dryness, it renders
them capable of preserving for a long time the type of a
strong and persistent imagination; and by its blackness, it
deprives them of their natural clarity and subtlety.””*

2. There is, besides this mechanics of qualities, a dynam-
ics that analyzes the strength to be found imprisoned in
each. Thus cold and dryness can enter into conflict with
the temperament, and this opposition will generate symp-
toms of melancholia violent in proportion to the struggle:

(zig)

 
  

Mavness & CivILizaTION

the strength that prevails and sweeps away all chat resists it.
Thus women, whose nature is little inclined to melancholy,
fall a prey to it all the more seriously: “They are cruelly
used and violently disturbed by it, for melancholia being
more opposed to their temperament, it removes them fur-
ther from their natural constitution.”*

3. But it is sometimes within the quality itself that the
conflict is generated. A quality may alter in the course of
its development and become the opposite of what it was.
Thus when “the entrails are heated, when all simmers
within the body .. . and ali the juices are consumed,”
then this conflagration can turn to cold melancholia—pro-
ducing “almost the same thing caused by the flow of wax in
a torch marned upside down. . . . This cooling of the
body is the ordinary effect which follows immoderate heat
once it has thrown off and exhausted its vigor.”* There is a
kind of dialectic of qualities which, free from any con-
straint of substance, from any predetermination, makes its
way through reversals and contradictions.

4. Finally, qualities may be altered by accidents, circum-
stances, the conditions of life; so that a being who is dry
and cold can become warm and humid, if his way of life
inclines him to it; as in the case of women: they “remain in
idleness, their bodies tend to perspire less [chan those of
men], and heat, spirits, and humors remain wichin.”*

Thus freed from a confining substantial basis, qualities
would be able to play an organizing and integrating role in
the notion of melancholia. On the one hand, they would
trace, among the symptoms and manifestations, a certain
profile of sadness, of blackness, of slowness, of immobility.
On the other, they would suggest a causal basis which
would no longer be the physiology of a humor, but the
pathology of an idea, of a fear, of a terror. The morbid
entity was not defized from observed signs nor from sup-
posed causes; but somewhere between, and beyond both, it

(220)
 Aspects of Madness

was perceived as a certain qualitative coherence, which had
its own laws of transmission, of development, and of trans-
formation. It is the secret logic of this quality that controls
the development of the idea of melancholia, not medical
theory. This is evident as early as Thomas Willis’s texts.

At first glance, the coherence of their analyses is
vouched for on the level of speculative reflection. Willis’s
explanation is borrowed whole from animal spirits and cheir
mechanical properties. Melancholia is “‘a madness without
fever or frenzy, accompanied by fear and sadness.” To the
extent that it is delirium—that is, an essential break with
truth—its origin resides in a disordered movement of the
spirits and in a defective state of the brain; but can that
fear, that anxiety which makes melancholics “sad and punc-
tilious,” be explained by movements alone? Might there be
a mechanism of fear and a circulation of spirits that is pecu-
liar to sadness? This is obvious to Descartes; it is no longer
so for Willis. Melancholia cannot be treated like a paralysis,
an apoplexy, a vertigo, or 2 convulsion. In fact, it cannot
even be analyzed as a simple dementia, although melan-
cholic delirium supposes a similar disorder in the movement
of spirits; disturbances in the mechanism easily explain de-
lirium—that error common to all madness, dementia or
melancholia—but not the quality peculiar to delirium, the
coloration of sadness and fear which makes its landscape so
unique. One must penetrate the secret of predispositions.
After all, it is these essential qualities, hidden in the very
grain of the subtle matter, that explain the paradoxical
movements of the spirits.

In melancholia, the spirits are swept by an agitation, but
a feeble agitation, without power or violence: a sort of
impotent jostling which does not follow marked paths, nor
open roads (aperta opercula), but traverses the cerebral
matter by endlessly creating new pores; yet the spirits do
not wander far upon the paths they trace; very soon their

(i271)

 
 Mavwness & CivILIZATION

agitation languishes, their strength fails, and the movement
stops: “they do not reach far.”7 Thus such disturbance,
common to all delirium, can produce on the surface of the
body neither those violent movements nor those cries that
may be observed in mania and frenzy; melancholia never
reaches violence; it is madness at the limits of its powerless-
ness, This paradox is the result of the secret alterations of
the spirits. Usually they have the quasi-immediate rapidity
and the absolute transparence of luminous rays; but in mel-
ancholia, they. are charged with darkness; they become
“obscure, opaque, shadowy”; and the images of things
which they bear to the brain and to the mind are veiled
with “shadow and with shades.” They become heavy and
closer to a dark chemical vapor than to pure light. A chem-
ical vapor that would be of an acid nature, rather than
sulfurous or alcoholic: for in acid vapors the particles are
mobile, and even incapable of rest, but their activity is
weak, without effect; when they are distilled, nothing re-
mains in the alembic but an insipid phlegm. Do not acid
vapors have the very properties of melancholia, whereas
alcoholic vapors, always ready to burst into flame, suggest
frenzy; and sulfurous vapors, agitated by a violent and con-
tinuous movement, indicate mania? If, then, one were to
seek “the formal reason and the causes” of melancholia, one
would consider the vapors that rise from the blood to the
brain and that have degenerated into an acid and corrosive
vapor. In appearance, it is a melancholia of the spirits, a
chemistry of the humors that oriented Willis’s analysis; but
in fact, the principal clue is afforded by the immediate qual-
ities of melancholic suffering: an impotent disorder, and
then that shadow over the mind, along with that acid bic-
terness which corrodes thought and feeling alike. The
chemistry of acids is not the explanation of the symptoms;
it is a qualitative option: a phenomenology of melancholic
experience.

(122)

 
  

Aspects of Madness

Some seventy years later, animal spirits lost their scien-
tific prestige. Now it was from the body’s liquid and solid
elements that the secret of disease was sought. The Medical
Dictionary which Robert James published in England in
1743 proposes, under Mania, a comparative etiology of that
disease and of melancholia: “It is evident that the brain is
the seat . . . of all diseases of this nature. . . . It is there
that the Creator has fixed, although in a manner which is
inconceivable, the lodging of the soul, the mind, genius,
imagination, memory, and all sensations. . . . All these
noble functions will be changed, depraved, diminished, and
totally destroyed, if the blood and the humors corrupted in
quality and quantity are no longer carried to the brain in a
uniform and temperate manner, but instead circulate there
with violence and impetuosity, or move about slowly, with
difficulty or with langnor.” It is this languishing flow, these
choked vessels, this heavy, clogged blood that the heart
labors to distribute throughout the organism, and which
has difficulty penetrating into the very fine arterioles of the
brain, where the circulation ought to be very rapid in order
to maintain the movement of thought—ic is al] this distress-
ing obstruction which explains melancholia. Heaviness, en-
cumbrance—here again the primitive qualities guide anal-
ysis. The explanation becomes a transfer to the organism of
qualities perceived in the condition, the conduct, the words
of the sick person. We move from qualitative apprehension
to supposed explanation. But it is this apprehension that
continues to prevail and always wins out over theoretical
coherence. Anne-Charles Lorry juxtaposes the two main
forms of medical explanation—by solids and by fluids—and
ultimately causes them to intersect, thus distinguishing two
kinds of melancholia, The one whose origin is in solids is
nervous melancholia: a particularly strong sensation agi-
tates the fibers which receive it; as a result, tension increases
in the other fibers, which become more rigid and at the

(123)

 
 MADNESS & CIVILIZATION

same time susceptible to further vibration. But should the
sensation become even stronger, then the tension increases
to such a degree in the other fibers that they become in-
capable of vibrating; the state of rigidity is such that the
flow of blood is stopped and the animal spirits immobilized.
Melancholia has set in. In the other form of disease, the
“fiquid form,” the humors are impregnated with black bile,
they become thicker; clogged with these humors, the blood
thickens and stagnates in the meninges until it compresses
the principal organs of the nervous system. Then we find
again the rigidity of the fibers, but in this case it is no more
than a consequence of a humoral phenomenon. Lorry dis-
tinguishes two melancholias: actually it is the same group
of qualities, affording melancholia its real unity, that he
employs successively in two explanatory systems. Only the
theoretical edifice has been doubled. The qualitative basis
in experience remains the same.

A symbolic unity formed by the languor of the fluids, by
the darkening of the animal spirits and the shadowy twi-
light they spread over the images of things, by the viscosity
of the blood that laboriously trickles through the vessels,
by the thickening of vapors that have become blackish,
deleterious, and acrid, by visceral functions that have be-
come slow and somehow slimy—this unity, more a product
of sensibility than of thought or theory, gives melancholia
its characteristic stamp.

Tt is this undertaking, more than faithful observation,
which reorganizes melancholia’s symptoms and mode of
appearance. The theme of a partial delirium increasingly
disappears as a major symptom of melancholics in favor of
qualitative data like sadness, bitterness, a preference for
solitude, immobility. At the end of the eighteenth century,
all forms of madness without delirium, but characterized
by inertia, by despair, by a sort of dull stupor, would be
readily classified as melancholia.* And as early as James’s

Aspects of Madness

Dictionary, an apoplectic melancholia is discussed, in which
the sufferers “refuse to rise from their beds . . . ; once on
their feet, they will not walk unless they are forced by
their friends or attendants; they in no way avoid others,
but they seem to pay no attention to what is said to them;
they make no answer.” If, in this case, immobility and si-
lence prevail and determine the diagnosis of melancholia,
there are cases in which one observes only bitterness, lan-
guor, and a preference for isolation; their very agitation
must not deceive the observer nor authorize a hasty diag-
nosis of mania; these patients are definitely suffering from
melancholia, for “they avoid company, prefer solitary
places, and wander without knowing where they are going;
they have a yellowish color, a dry tongue as in a person
suffering from great thirst, and their eyes are dry, hollow,
never moistened with tears; their entire body is dry and
burning hot, their face dark, and expressing only horror
and sadness.””*

The analyses of mania and their evolution during the
classical period obey the same principles of coherence,

Willis opposes mania to melancholia. The mind of the
melancholic is entirely occupied by reflection, so that his
imagination remains at leisure and in repose; the maniac’s
imagination, on the contrary, is occupied by a perpetual
flux of impetuous thoughts. While the melancholic’s mind
is fixed on a single object, imposing unreasonable propor-
tions upon it, but upon it alone, mania deforms all concepts
and ideas; either they lose their congruence, or their repre-
sentative value is falsified; in any case, the totality of
thought is disturbed in its essential relation to truth. Melan-
cholia, finally, is always accompanied by sadness and fear;
on the contrary, in the maniac we find audacity and fury.
Whether it is a question of mania or melancholia, the cause
of the disease is always in the movement of the animal

(125)

 
  

Mavness & CIVILIZATION

spirits. But this movement is quite particular in mania: it is
continuous, violent, always capable of piercing new pores
in the cerebral matter, and it creates, as the material basis of
incoherent thoughts, explosive gestures, continuous words
which betray mania. Is not such pernicious mobility that of
an infernal water, sulfurous liquid, those aquae stygiae, ex
nitro, vitriolo, antimonio, arsenico, et similibus exstillatae:
its particles are in perpetual movement; they are capable of
provoking new pores and new channels in any substance;
and they have strength enough to spread themselves far,
exactly as the maniacal spirits are capable of spreading agi-
tation through all the parts of the body. An infernal water
gathers in the secrecy of its movements all the images in
which mania takes its concrete form. It constitutes, in an
indissociable way, both its chemical myth and its dynamic
truth,

In the course of the eighteenth century, the image, with
all its mechanical and metaphysical implications, of animal
spirits in the channels of the nerves, was frequently re-
placed by the image, more strictly physical but of an even
more symbolic value, of a tension to which nerves, vessels,
and the entire system of organic fibers were subject. Mania
was thus a tension of the fibers carried to its paroxysm, the
maniac a sort of instrument whose strings, by the effect of
an exaggerated traction, began to vibrate at the remotest
and faintest stimulus. Maniacal delirium consisted of a con-
tinual vibration of the sensibility. Through this image, the
differences from melancholia became precise and were or-
ganized into a rigorous antithesis: the melancholic can no
longer enter into 2 resonance with the external world, be-
cause his fibers are relaxed or because they have been im-
mobilized by too great a tension (we see how the mechan-
ics of tension explains melancholic immobility as well as
maniacal agitation): only a few fibers vibrate in the melan-
cholic, those which correspond to the precise point of his

(726)

 
 Aspects of Madness

delirium. On the contrary, the maniac vibrates to any and
every stimulus; his delirium is universal; stimuli do not
vanish into the density of his immobility, as in the melan-
cholic’s case; when his organism returns them, they have
been multiplied, as if the maniac had accumulated a sup-
plementary energy in the tension of his fibers, It is this very
fact, moreover, that makes the maniac, in his turn, insen-
sible, not with the somnolent insensibilicy of the melan-
cholic, but with an insensibiliry taut with interior vibra-
tions; this is doubtless why maniacs “fear neither heat nor
cold, tear off their clothes, sleep naked in the dead of win-
ter without feeling the cold.” It is also why they substitute
for the real world, which nonetheless continues to solicit
them, the unreal and chimerical world of their delirium:
“The essential symptoms of mania result from the fact that
objects do not present themselves to the sufferers as they
are in reality.”*° The delirium of maniacs is not deter-
mined by 2 particular error of judgment; it constitutes a
defect in the transmission of sense impressions to the brain,
a flaw in communication. In the psychology of. madness,
the old idea of truth as “the conformity of thought to
things” is transposed in the metaphor of a resonance, a kind
of musical fidelity of the fibers to the sensations which
make them vibrate.

This theme of manic tension develops, beyond a medi-
cine of solids, into intuitions that are still more qualitative.
The rigidity of fibers in a maniac always belongs to a dry
landscape; mania is regularly accompanied by 2 wasting of
the humors, and by 2 general aridity in the entire organism.
The essence of mania is desertic, sandy. Théophile Bonet,
in his Sepulchretum anatomicum, declares that the brains of
maniacs, insofar as he had been able to observe them, al-
‘ways seemed to be in a state of dryness, of hardness, and of
friabiliry. Later, Albrecht von Haller also found that the
maniac’s brain was hard, dry, and brittle. Menuret repeats

(127)

 
    

 
   

MAvNESS & CIVILIZATION

an observation of Forestier’s that clearly shows how an
excessive loss of a humor, by drying out the vessels and
fibers, may provoke a state of mania; this was the case of a
young man who “having married his wife in the summer-
time, became maniacal as a result of the excessive inter-
course he had with her.”

What some imagined or supposed, what others saw in a
quasi-perception, Dufour proved, numbered, named. Dur-
ing an autopsy, he removed part of the medullary sub-
stance from the brain of a subject who had died in a state of
mania; he cut out “a cube six lines in each direction” the
weight of which was 3 j.g. III, while the same volume taken
from an ordinary brain weighed 3 j.g. V: “this inequality
in weight, which seems at first of little consequence, is no
longer so slight if we consider the fact that the specific
difference between the total mass of the brain of a madman
and that of a normal man is around 7 gros less in the adult,
in whom the brain’s entire mass ordinarily weighs three
livres.” Mania’s dessication and lightness show even on the
scale,

Were not this internal dryness and this heat further
proved by the ease with which maniacs endured great
cold? It was an established fact that they had been seen
walking naked in the snow, that there was no need to warm
them when they were confined in the asylum, that they
could even be cured by cold. Since Jean-Baptiste van Hel-
mont, the immersion of maniacs in ice water had been
widely practiced, and Menuret states that he knew a ma-
niac who, having escaped from the prison where he was
kept, “walked several leagues in a violent rain without a hat
and almost without clothing, and who by this means recov-
ered perfect health.” Montchau, who cured a maniac by
“pouring ice water upon him, from as high above as pos-
sible,” was not astonished by so favorable a result, to ex-
plain it he united all the themes of organic calefaction that

(128)
 Aspects of Madness

had succeeded and intersected each other since the seven-
teenth century: “One need not be surprised that ice water
produces such a prompt and perfect cure precisely when
boiling blood, furious bile, and mutinous liquors carried
disturbance and irritation everywhere”; by the impression
of coldness, “the vessels contracted more violently and
freed themselves of the liquors that crammed them, the
irritation of the solid parts caused by the extreme heat of
the liquors they contained ceased, and when the nerves
relaxed, the course of the spirits that had proceeded irregu-
larly from one side to the other was re-established in its
natural state.”

The world of melancholia was humid, heavy, and cold;
that of mania was parched, dry, compounded of violence
and fragility; a world which heat—unfelt but everywhere
manifested—made arid, friable, and always ready to relax
under the effect of a moist coolness. In the development of
all these qualitative simplifications, mania attained both its
full scope and its unity. It has doubtless remained what it
was at the beginning of the seventeenth century, “fury
without fever,” but beyond these two characteristics,
which were still only descriptive, there developed a percep-
tual theme which was the real organizer of the clinical pic-
ture. Once the explanatory myths disappeared, and hu-
mors, spirits, solids, fluids no longer had any currency,
there would remain only the schema of coherent qualities
which would no longer even be named, and what this dy-
namics of heat and movement slowly formed into a constel-
lation characteristic of mania would now be observed as a
natural complex, as an immediate truth of psychological
observation. What had been perceived as heat, imagined as
agitation of spirits, conceived as fibrous tension, would
henceforth be recognized in the neutralized transparency
of psychological notions: exaggerated vivacity of internal
impressions, rapidity in the association of ideas, inattention

(129)

 
 Mavness & CIVILIZATION

to the external world. De Ja Rive’s description already has
this limpidity: “External objects do not produce upon the
mind of a sufferer the same impression as upon the mind of
a healthy man; these impressions are weak, and the sufferer
rarely heeds them; his mind is almost entirely absorbed by
the action of the ideas produced by the deranged state of
his brain. These ideas have such a degree of vivacity that
the sufferer believes they represent real objects, and judges
accordingly.” But we must not forget that this psycholog-
ical structure of mania, as it appeared and was stabilized at
the end of the eighteenth century, is only the superficial
sketch of an entire profound organization, which itself
would capsize and which had developed according to the
half-perceptual, half-iconographic laws of a qualitative
world,

No doubt this entire universe of heat and cold, of humid-
ity and dryness, reminded medical thought, about to accede
to positivism, of the circumstances of its own origin. But
this blazon of images was not simply reminiscence; it was
also an undertaking. In order to form the practical experi-
ence of mania or melancholia, this gravitation, against 2
background of images, of qualities attracted to each other
by a whole system of sensuous and affective affinities was
essential. If mania, if melancholia henceforth assumed the
aspects our science knows them by, it is not because in the
course of centuries we have learned to “open our eyes” to
real symptoms; it is not because we have purified our per-
ception to the point of transparency; it is because in the
experience of madness, these concepts were organized
around certain qualitative themes that lent them their
unity, gave them their significant coherence, made them
finally perceptible. We have passed from a simple notional
description (fury without fever, delirious idée fixe) to a
qualitative realm, apparently less organized, simpler, less
precisely limited, but which alone was able to. constitute

(230)

 
 Aspects of Madness

recognizable, palpable units really present in the total ex-
perience of madness. The field of observation of these dis-
eases was partitioned into landscapes that obscurely gave
them their style and their structure. On the one hand, a
sodden, almost diluvian world, where man remained deaf,
blind, and numb to all that was not his one terror: a world
simplified in the extreme, and immoderately enlarged in 2
single one of its details. On the other, a parched and
desertic world, a panic world where all was flight, dis-
order, instantaneous gesture. It was the rigor of these
themes in their cosmic form—not the approximations of an
observing caution—which organized the experience (al-
ready almost our own experience) of mania and melan-
cholia.

Ie is Willis, with his spirit of observation, the purity of
his medical perception, whom we honor as the “discoverer”
of the mania-melancholia alternation. Certainly Willis’s
methods are of great interest, chiefly in this particular: the
transition from one affection to the other is seen not as 2
phenomenon of observation for which it was then a matter
of discovering the explanation, but rather as the conse-
quence of a profound natural affinity which was of the
order of their secret nature. Willis does not cite a single
case of alternation which he had occasion to observe; what
he first discovered was an internal relation which engen-
dered strange metamorphoses: “After melancholia, we
must consider mania, with which it has so many affinities
that these complaints often change into one another”: it
happens, in fact, chat the melancholic predisposition, if ag-
gravated, becomes frenzy; frenzy, on the contrary, when it
decreases and loses its force, finally grows calm and turns
to melancholic diathesis. A rigorous empiricism would see
two related diseases here, or even two successive symptoms
of the same disease. However, Willis does not pose the

(231)

 
 Mavwness & CIVILIZATION

problem in terms of symptoms nor in terms of disease; he
merely seeks the link connecting two states in the dynamics
of animal spirits. In the melancholic, we remember, the spir-
its were somber and dim; they cast their shadows over the
images of things and formed a kind of dark tide; in the
maniac, on the contrary, the spirits seethed in a perpetual
ferment; they were carried by an irregular movement, con-
stantly repeated; 2 movement that eroded and consumed,
and even without fever, sent out its heat. Between mania
and melancholia, the affinity is evident: not the affinity of
symptoms linked in experience, but the affinity—more
powerful and so much more evident in the landscapes of
the imagination—that unites in the same fire both smoke
and flame. “If we can say that in melancholia, the brain and
the animal spirits are obscured by smoke and a dense vapor,
mania seems to ignite a kind of conflagration hitherto
muffled by them.” The flame in its rapid movement dis-
sipates the smoke; but the smoke, when it fails back, smoth-
ers the flame and extinguishes its brightness. The combina-
tion of mania and melancholy is not, for Willis, 2 disease; it
is a secret fire in which flame and smoke are in conflict; it is
the vehicle of that light and that shadow.

Virtually all of the physicians of the eighteenth century
acknowledged the proximity of mania and melancholia.
Several, however, refused to call them two manifestations
of the same disease. Many observed a succession without
perceiving a symptomatic unity. Sydenham prefers to di-
vide the domain of mania itself: on one hand, ordinary
mania—due to “an overexcited and too rapid blood”; on
the other, a mania which, as a general rule, “degenerates
into stupidity.” The latter “results from the weakness of
the blood which too long a fermentation has deprived of its
most spirituous parts.” Even more often, it is acknowl-
edged that the succession of mania and melancholia is a

(732)

 
 Aspects of Madness

phenomenon either of metamorphosis or of remote causal-
ity. For Joseph Lieutaud, a melancholia that lasts a long
time and whose delirium is exacerbated loses its traditional
symptoms and assumes a strange resemblance to mania:
“the last stage of melancholia has many affinities with
mania.” But the status of this analogy is not elaborated. For
Dufour, the tink is even looser: it is a remote causal connec-
tion, melancholia being able to provoke mania, as well as
“Svorms in the frontal sinuses, or dilated or varicose ves-
sels.” Without the support of an image, no observation suc-
ceeded in transforming the evidence of succession into a
symptomatic structure that was both precise and essential.

Of course the image of flame and smoke disappeared in
Willis’s successors; but it was still by images that the work
of organization was accomplished—images increasingly
functional, more firmly fixed in the great physiological
themes of circulation and heating, increasingly remote
from the cosmic figures Willis had borrowed them from.
For Boerhaave and his commentator Gerard van Swieten,
mania formed quite naturally the highest degree of melan-
cholia—not only following a frequent metamorphosis, but
as the result of a necessary dynamic sequence: the cerebral
Liquid, which stagnates in the melancholic, becomes agi-
tated after a certain time, for the black bile that fills the
viscera becomes by its very immobility “bitterer and more
malignant”; there then form in it more acid and subtler
elements which, carried to the brain by the blood, provoke
the maniac’s great agitation. Mania is thus distinguished
from melancholia only by a difference of degree: it is its
natural consequence, it results from the same causes, and is
ordinarily treated by the same remedies. For Friedrich
Hoffmann, the unity of mania and melancholia is a natural
effect of the laws of movement and shock; but what is pure
mechanics on the level of principles becomes dialectics in

(733)

 
  

MADNESS & CIVILIZATION

the development of life and of disease. Melancholia, in
effect, is characterized by immobility; in other words, the
thickened blood congests the brain where it accumulates;
where ir ought to circulate, it tends to stop, immobilized by
its heaviness. But if this heaviness retards movement, it also
makes the shock more violent at the moment it occurs; the
brain, the vessels by which it is traversed, its very sub-
stance, more violently jarred, tend to resist more, therefore
to harden, and by this hardening the thickened blood is
sent back more energetically; its movement increases and it
is soon caught up in that agitation which is mania. We have
thus passed quite naturally from the image of an immobile
congestion to images of dryness, of hardness, of rapid
movement, and this by a sequence in which the principles
of classical mechanics are at every moment influenced, de-
flected, distorted by a fidelity to iconographic themes
which are the true organizers of this functional unity.
Subsequently other images will be added, but will no
longer play a constitutive role; they will function only as
so many interpretive variations upon the theme of a previ-
ously acquired unity. Witness for example the explanation
Spengler proposed for the alternation between mania and
melancholia, borrowing its principle from the electric bat-
tery. First there is a concentration of nervous power and of
its fluid in a certain region of the system; only this sector is
agitated, all the rest is in a state of sleep: this is the melan-
cholic phase. But. when it reaches a certain degree of inten-
sity, this local charge suddenly expands into the entire sys-
tem, which ir agitates violently for a certain time, until its
discharge is complete: this is the manic episode. At this
level of elaboration, the image is too complex and too com-
plete, it is borrowed from a model too remote to have an
organizing role in the perception of a pathological unity. It
is, on the contrary, suggested by that perception, which

(234)
  Aspects of Madness

itself is based on unifying, though much more elementary,
images.

It is these images which are secretly present in the text of
James's Dictionary, one of the first in which the manic-
depressive cycle is given as an observed phenomenon, as 2
unity easily perceived by an unprejudiced scrutiny. “It is
absolutely necessary to reduce melancholia and mania to 2
single species of disease, and consequently to consider them
in one and the same glance, for we find from our experi-
ments and our day-to-day observations that one and the
other have the same origin and the same cause. . . . The
most exact observations and our daily experience confirm
the fact, for we see that melancholics, especially those in
whom the disposition is inveterate, easily become maniacal,
and when the mania ceases, the melancholia begins again, in
such a way that there is a passage and return from one to
the other after certain periods of time.”"! What was con-
stituted, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, under
the influence of images, was therefore a perceptual struc-
ture, and not a conceptual system or even a group of symp-
toms, The proof of this is that, just as in a perception,
qualitative transitions could occur without affecting the
integrity of the figure. Thus William Cullen would dis-
cover in mania, as in melancholia, “a principal object of
delirium”—and, inversely, would attribute melancholia to
“a drier and firmer tissue of the brain’s medullary sub-
stance.”

The essential thing is that the enterprise did not proceed
from observation to the construction of explanatory im-
ages; thar on the contrary, the images assured the initial
role of synthesis, that their organizing force made possible a
structure of perception, in which at last the symptoms
could attain their significant value and be organized as the
visible presence of the truth.

Il. Hysteria and Hypochondria

‘Two problems arise where these are concerned.

1. To what degree is it legitimate to treat them as mental
diseases, or at least as forms of madness?

2, Are we entitled to treat them together, as if they con-
stituted a virtual couple, similar to that formed quite early
by mania and melancholia?

A glance at the classifications is enough to convince us;
hypochondria does not always appear beside dementia and
mania; hysteria is very rarely found there. Felix Plater
mentioned neither one among the lesions of the senses; and
at the end of the classical period, Cullen still catalogued
them in another category than that of the vesanias: hypo-
chondria among the “adynamias, or diseases which consist
of a weakness or a loss of movement in the vital or animal
functions”; hysteria among “the spasmodic affections of
the natural functions.”

Moreover, in nosographic charts one rarely finds these
two diseases grouped in a logical proximity, or even com-
bined in the form of an opposition, Sauvages classifies
hypochondria among the _hallucinations—“hallucinations
that concern only the health”—hysteria among the forms
of convulsion. Linnaeus employs the same distinctions. Are
they not both faithful to the teaching of Willis, who had
studied hysteria in his book De morbis convulsivis and
hypochondria in the section of De anima brutorum which
dealt with diseases of the head, giving it the name of passio
colica? Here it is certainly a question of rwo quite different
diseases; in one case, the overheated spirits are subject to a
reciprocal pressure which may give the impression that
they are exploding—provoking those irregular or preter-
natural movements whose insane aspect constitutes hyster-
ical convulsions. On the contrary, in passio colica, the spir-

(136)
  

Aspects of Madness

its are irritated because of a matter that is hostile and
inappropriate to them (infesta et improportionnata); they
then provoke disturbances, irritations, corrugationes in the
sensitive fibers. Willis therefore advises us not to be sur-
prised by certain analogies of symptoms: certainly, we
have seen convulsions produce pains as if the violent move-
ment of hysteria could provoke the sufferings of hypo-
chondria. But the resemblances are deceptive. “The
substance is not the same, but a little different.”

But beneath these fixed distinctions of the nosographers,
a slow labor was being performed which tended increas-
ingly to identify hysteria and hypochondria, as two forms
of one and the same disease. In 1725 Richard Blackmore
published a Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours, or Hypo-
chondriacal and Hysterical Affections; in it the two ill-
nesses were defined as two varieties of a single affection—
either a “morbific constitution of the spirits” or a “disposi-
tion to leave their reservoirs and to consume themselves.”
For Whytt, in the middle of the eighteenth century, the
identification was complete; the system of symptoms is
henceforth identical: “An extraordinary sensation of cold
and heat, of pains in several parts of the body; syncopes
and vaporous convulsions; catalepsy and tetanus; gas in the
stomach and intestines; an insatiable appetite for food;
vomiting of black matter; a sudden and abundant flow of
clear, pale urine; marasma or nervous atrophy; nervous
cough; palpitations of the heart; variations in the pulse;
periodic headaches; vertigo and dizzy spells; diminution
and failure of eyesight; depression, despair, melancholia or
even madness; nightmares or incubi.”

Moreover, during the classical period hysteria and hypo-
chondria slowly joined the domain of mental diseases,
Richard Mead could still write apropos of hypochondria:
“Tr is an illness of the whole body.” And we must restore its
true value to Willis’s text on hysteria: “Among the diseases

(2:37)

 

  
  

Mapness & CIVILIZATION

of women, hysterical affection is of such bad repute that
like the semi-dammnati it must bear the faults of numerous
other affections; if a disease of unknown nature and hidden
origin appears in a woman in such a manner that its cause
escapes us, and that the therapeutic course is uncertain, we
immediately blame the bad influence of the uterus, which,
for the most part, is not responsible; and when we are deal-
ing with an inhabitual symptom, we declare that there is 2
trace of hysteria hidden beneath it all, and what has so
often been the subterfuge of so much ignorance we take as
the object of our treatment and our remedies.” With all
due regard to the traditional commentators on this text,
which is inevitably cited in any study on hysteria, it does
not mean that Willis suspected the absence of an organic
basis in symptoms of hysterical affection. He merely says,
and in an explicit way, that the idea of hysteria is a catchall
for the fantasies, not of the person who is or believes him-
self ill, but of the ignorant doctor who pretends to know
why, Nor does the fact that hysteria is classified by Willis
among diseases of the head indicate that he considered it a
disorder of the mind; but only that he attributed its origin
to a change in the nature, the origin, and the initial course
of the animal spirits.

However, at the end of the eighteenth century, hypo-
chondria and hysteria figured, almost without dispute, on
the escutcheon of mental disease. In 1755 Alberti published
at Halle his dissertation De morbis imaginariis hypochon-
driacorum; and Lieutaud, while defining hypochondria by
its spasms, recognized that “the mind is affected as much as
and perhaps more than the body, hence the term hypo-
chondriac has become almost an offensive name avoided by
physicians who would please.” As for hysteria, Joseph Rau-
lin no longer ascribes to it any organic reality, at least in his
basic definition, establishing it from the start in a pathology
of the imagination: ‘This disease in which women invent,

(738)

 
  

 

Aspects of Madness

exaggerate, and repeat all the various absurdities of which a
disordered imagination is capable, has sometimes become
epidemic and contagious.”

There were thus two essential lines of development, dur-
ing the classical period, for hysteria and hypochondria.
One united them to form a common concept which was
that of a “disease of the nerves”; the other shifted their
meaning and their traditional pathological basis—suffi-
ciently indicated by their names—and tended to integrate
them gradually into the domain of diseases of the mind,
beside mania and melancholia. But this integration was not
achieved, as in the case of mania and melancholia, on the
level of primitive qualities, perceived and imagined in their
iconographic values. We are dealing here with an entirely
different type of integration.

The physicians of the classical period certainly tried to
discover the qualities peculiar to hysteria and hypochon-
dria, But they never reached the point of perceiving that
particular coherence, that qualitative cohesion which gave
mania and melancholia their unique contour. All qualities
were contradictorily invoked, each annulling the others,
leaving untouched the problem of what was the ultimate
nature of these two diseases.

Often hysteria was perceived as the effect of an internal
heat that spread throughout the entire body, an efferves-
cence, an ebullition ceaselessly manifested in convulsions
and spasms, Was this heat not related to the amorous ardor

with which hysteria was so often linked, in girls looking for
husbands and in young widows who had lost theirs? Hys-
teria was ardent, by nature; its symptoms referred more
easily to an image than to an illness, that image was drawn
by Jacques Ferrand, at the beginning of the seventeenth
century, in all its material precision. In his Maladie @’amour
ou mélancholie érotique, he declared that women were

(739)
   

    

MaovNEsSsS & CIVILIZATION

more often distracted by love than men; but with what art
they could dissimulate it! “In which their mien is similar to
alembics featly resting upon cylinders, without one’s being
able to see the fire from without, yet if one looks beneath
the alembic, and places one’s hand upon a woman's heart,
one will find in both places a fiery furnace.” An admirable
image, in its symbolic weight, its affective overtones, and
the referential play of its imagery. Long after Ferrand, one
finds the qualifying theme of humid heat used to character-
ize the secret distillations of hysteria and of hypochondria;
bur the image yielded to a more abstract motif. Already in
Nicolas Chesneau, the flame of the feminine alembic had
grown quite colorless: “I say that the hysterical affection is
not 2 simple one, but that we understand by this name
several diseases caused by a malign vapor which arises in
some way or other, is corrupted, and undergoes an ex-
traordinary effervescence.” For others, on the contrary,
the heat rising from the hypochondriac regions is com-
pletely dry: hypochondriacal melancholia is a “hot, dry”
illness, caused by “humors of the like quality.” But some
perceived no heat in either hysteria or hypochondria: the
quality peculiar to these maladies was on the contrary lan-
guor, inertia, and a cold humidity like that of the stagnant
humors: “I think that these affections [hypochondriacal
and hysterical], when they last for some time, come from
the fibers of the brain and the nerves when they are slack
and therefore feeble, without action or elasticity; as a con-
sequence of which the nervous fluid is impoverished and
without force.”? There is probably no text that bears bet-
ter witness to the qualitative instabilicy of hysteria than
George Cheyne’s book The English Malady: according to
Cheyne, the disease maintains its unity only in an abstract
manner; its symptoms are dispersed into different qualita-
tive regions and attributed to mechanisms that belong to
each of these regions in its own right. All symptoms of

(740)

 
 Aspects of Madness

spasm, cramp, and convulsion derive from a pathology of
heat symbolized by “harmful, bitter, or acrimonious va-
pors.” On the contrary, all psychological or organic signs
of weakness—‘“depression, syncopes, inactivity of the
mind, lethargic torpor, melancholia, and sadness” —mani-
fest a condition of fibers which have become too humid or
too weak, doubtless under the effect of cold, viscous, thick
humors that obstruct the glands and the vessels, serous and
sanguine alike. As for paralyses, they signify both a chilling
and an immobilization of the fibers, “‘an interruption of
vibrations,” frozen so to speak in the general inertia of
solids,

Tt was as difficult for the phenomena of hysteria and
hypochondria to find a place within the compass of quali-
ties as it was easy for mania and melancholia to be estab-
lished there.

The medicine of movement was just as indecisive in
dealing with them, its analyses just as unstable. It was quite
clear, at least to any perception that did not reject its own
images, that mania was related to an excessive mobility;
melancholia, on the contrary, to a diminution of move-
ment. For hysteria and for hypochondria as well, the
choice was a difficult one. Georg Ernst Stahl opts instead
for an increasing heaviness of the blood, which becomes so
abundant and so thick that it is no longer capable of circu-
lating regularly through the portal vein; it has a tendency
to stagnate, to collect there, and the crisis is a result “of the
effort it makes to effect an issue either by the higher or the
lower parts.” For Boerhaave, on the contrary, and for Van.
Swieten, hysterical movement is due to an excessive mobil-
ity of all the fluids, which become so volatile, so incon-
sistent, that they are agitated by the least movement: “In
weak constitutions,” Van Swieten explains, “the blood is
dissolved; it barely coagulates, the serum is thus without
consistency, without quality; the lymph resembles the se-

(247)

 
 Mavness & CIVILIZATION

ram, as do the other fluids which the latter provides. .

In this way, it becomes probable that the so-called immate-
rial hysterical affection and hypochondriacal disease derive
from the dispositions of the particular state of the fibers.” Ic
is to this sensibility, this mobility, that we must attribute
the sufferings, the spasms, the singular pains so readily
suffered by “young girls of pale complexion, and individu-
als too much given to study and nieditation.” Hysteria is
indiscriminately mobile or immobile, fluid or dense, given
to unstable vibrations or clogged by stagnant humors. No
one has managed to discover the actual nature of its move-
ments.

We receive the same impression in the realm of chemical
analogies: for Lange, hysteria is a product of fermentation,
quite precisely of the fermentation “of salts, sent into
different parts of the body,” with “the humors that are
located there.” For others, it is of an alkaline nature. Mi-
chael Ettmiller, on the contrary, considers that diseases of
this kind belong to a chain of acid reactions, “the immedi-
ate cause being the acid rawness of the stomach; the chyle
being acid, the quality of the blood is corrupted; it no
longer furnishes spirits; the lymph is acid, the bile without
strength; the nervous system suffers irritation, the digestive
leaven, spoiled, is less volatile and too acid.” Viridet under-
takes to reconstitute, apropos of “vapors which we experi-
ence,” a dialectic of alkalis and acids whose movements and
violent collisions, in the brain and the nerves, provoke the
signs of hysteria and hypochondria. Certain particularly
volatile animal spirits are alkaline salts that move with great
speed and transform themselves into vapors when they be-
come too tenuous; but there are other vapors that are vol-
atilized acids; the ether gives these latter enough movement
to carry them to the brain and the nerves where, “encoun-
tering the alkalis, they cause infinite ills.”

Strange, the qualitative instability of these hysterical and

(142)

 
  

 

 

Aspects of Madness

hypochondriacal illnesses; strange, the confusion of their
dynamic properties and the secret nature of their chem-
istry! To the very degree that the diagnosis of mania and
melancholia seemed simple in the context of qualities, so the
decipherment of these illnesses seemed hesitant. No doubt,
this imaginary landscape of qualities which was decisive for
the constitution of the melancholia-mania couple remained
secondary in the history of hysteria and hypochondria,
where it probably played no more than the role of continu-
ally shifted scenery. The progress of hysteria did not lead,
as did that of mania, through the world’s obscure qualities
reflected in a medical imagery. The space in which it as-
somed its dimensions was of another kind: that of the
body, in the coherence of its organic values and its moral
values.

Ic is customary to credit Charles le Pois and Willis with
liberating hysteria from the old myths of uterine displace-
ment. Jean Li¢bault, translating or rather adapting Mari-
nello’s book to seventeenth-century standards, still ac-
cepted, despite some restrictions, the idea of a spontaneous
movement of the womb; if it shifted position “it was to be
more at ease; not that this was done out of prudence, be-
hest, or animal stimulus, but to preserve health and to ex-
perience the enjoyment of something delectable.” No
doubt, it was no longer deemed possible for the womb to
change place or to course through the body somersaulting
as it went, for it was “strictly attached” by its neck, by
ligaments, by vessels, and finally by the tunic of the peri-
toneum; yet it could change position: “And so the womb,
though it be so strictly attached to the parts we have de-
scribed that it may not change place, yet often changes
position, and makes curious and so to speak perulant move-
ments in the woman’s body. These movements are various:
to wit, ascending, descending, convulsive, vagrant, pro-

(243)

 
  

MADNESS & CIVILIZATION

lapsed. The womb rises to the liver, spleen, diaphragm,
stomach, breast, heart, lung, gullet, and head.” The physi-
cians of the classical period were almost unanimous in
refusing to accept such an explanation.

At the beginning of the seventeenth century, Le Pois
could write, speaking of hysterical convulsions: “Of all
these one source is the father, and this not through sym-
pathy but through idiopathy.” More precisely, their origin
is in an accumulation of fluids toward the posterior part of
the skull: “Just as a river results from the confluence of a
quantity of smaller vessels which join to form it, so the
sinuses that are on the surface of the brain and terminate in
the posterior part of the head amass the liquid because of
the head’s inclined position. The heat of the parts then
causes the liquid to warm and affect the origin of the
nerves.” Willis, in his tum, makes 2 minute critique of the
uterine explanation: it is especially from affections of the
brain and the nervous system “that all the derangements
and irregularities which obtain in the movement of the
blood during this illness derive.” And yet all these analyses
did not thereby abolish the idea of an essential link between
hysteria and the womb. But the link is differently con-
ceived: it is no longer regarded as the trajectory of a real
displacement through the body, but as a sort of secret prop-
agation through the pathways of the organism and through
functional proximities. We cannot say that the seat of the
disease had become the brain, nor that Willis had made
possible a psychological analysis of hysteria. But the brain
now played the part of a relay station and the distributor of
a disease whose origin was visceral: the womb occasioned it
along with all the other viscera. Until the end of the eigh-
teenth century, until Pinel, the uterus and the womb re-
mained present in the pathology of hysteria, but as the
result of a privileged diffusion by the humors and nerves,
and not by a special prestige of their nature.

(744)

 Aspects of Madness

Stahl justifies the parallelism of hysteria and hypochon-
dria by a curious comparison of menstrual flow and hemor-
thoids. He explains, in his analysis of spasmodic move-
ments, that the hysterical affection is a violent pain, “ac-
companied by tension and compression, which makes itself
principally felt below the hypochondriac regions.” It is
called a hypochondriacal disease when it attacks men “in
whom nature makes an effort to be rid of excess blood by
vomiting or hemorrhoids”; it is called a hysterical affection
* when it attacks women “the course of whose periods is not
as it should be. However, there is no essential difference
between these two affections.” Hoffman's opinion is quite
similar, in spite of many theoretical differences. The cause
of hysteria is in the womb—loosening and weakening—but |
the seat of the disease is to be sought, ‘as in the case of
hypochondria, in the stomach and the intestines; the blood
and the vital humors begin to stagnate “in the membranous
and nervous tunics of the intestines”; gastric disturbances
result, which spread thence throughout the whole body. At
the very center of the organism, the stomach serves as a
relay station and diffuses the maladies that come from the
interior and subterranean cavities of the body: “It is not to
be doubted that the spasmodic affections experienced by
hypochondriacs and hysterics have their seat in the nervous
parts, and especially in the membranes of the stomach and
the intestines, from which they are communicated by the
intercostal nerve to the head, to the chest, to the kidneys,
to the liver, and to all the principal organs of the body.”

The role Hoffmann assigns to the intestines, the stomach,
and the intercostal nerve is indicative of the manner in
which the problem was presented in the classical period. It
‘was not so much a question of escaping the old localization
in the uterus, but of discovering the principle and the path-
ways of a diverse, polymorphous disease dispersed
throughout the entire body. A disease was to be accounted

(145)

 
 Mavness & CIVILIZATION

for that could attack the head as well as the legs, express
itself in a paralysis or in frenzied movements, that could
bring on catalepsy or insomnia: in short, a disease that
traversed corporeal space so rapidly and so ingeniously that
it was virtually present throughout the entire body.

It is futile to insist on the change of medical horizons that
occurred from Marinello to Hoffmann. Nothing subsists of
that famous mobility ascribed to the uterus, which had
constantly figured in the Hippocratic tradition. Nothing,
except perhaps 2 certain theme which appeared more
clearly now that it was no longer confined to 2 single med-
ical theory, but persisted unchanged through the succession
of speculative concepts and explanatory schemas. This was
the theme of a dynamic upheaval of corporeal space, of a
tide of the lower powers, which, too long constrained and,
as it were, congested, began to seethe and ultimately spread
their disorder—with or without the brain’s mediation—
through the entire body. This theme remained almost sta-
tionary until the beginning of the eighteenth century, de-
spite the complete reorganization of physiological con-
cepts. And strangely enough, it was during the. eighteenth
century, when no theoretical or experimental innovation in
pathology had occurred, that the theme was suddenly mod-
ified, changed direction—that a dynamics of corporeal
space was replaced by a morality of sensibility. It was then,
and only then, that the ideas of hysteria and hypochondria
‘were to veer, and definitively enter the world of madness,

We must try now to reconstitute the evolution of the
theme, in each of its three stages:

1. a dynamics of organic and moral penetration;

2. a physiology of corporeal continuity;

3- an ethic of nervous sensibility.

If corporeal space is perceived as a solid and continuous
whole, the disordered movement of hysteria and of hypo-

(246)

chondria could result only from an element whose extreme
tenuousness and incessant mobility permitted it to penetrate
into the place occupied by the solids themselves. As Na-
thaniel Highmore put it, the animal spirits, “because of
their igneous tenuity, can penetrate even the densest, the
most compact bodies . . . , and because of their activity,
can penetrate the entire microcosm in a single instant.” The
spirits, if their mobility increased, if penetration occurred,
chaotically and in an untimely manner, in all the parts of
the body to which they were unsuited, provoked a thou-
sand diverse signs of disturbance. Hysteria, for Highmore
as for Willis, his adversary, and for Sydenham as well, was
the disease of 2 body indiscriminately penetrable to all the
efforts of the spirits, so that the internal order of organs
gave way to the incoherent space of masses passively sub-
ject to the chaotic movement of the spirits, These latter
“move impetuously and in excessive quantity upon such or
such a part, there causing spasms or even pain . . . and
disturbing the function of the organs, both those which
they abandon and those toward which they move, neither
being able to avoid serious damage from this unequal dis-
tribution of spirits, which is entirely contrary to the laws
of animal economy.”* The hysterical body was thus given
over to that disorder of the spirits which, outside of all
organic laws and any functional necessity, could succes-
sively seize upon all the available spaces of the body.

The effects varied according to the regions affected, and
the disease, undifferentiated in the pure source of its move-
ment, assumed various configurations depending on the
spaces it traversed and the surfaces where it appeared:
“Having accumulated in the stomach, they rush in a host
and with impetuosity upon the muscles of the larynx and
the pharynx, producing spasms throughout the entire area
they traverse, and causing in the stomach a swelling which
resembles a large ball.” A little higher, the hysterical affec-

(147)

 
  

Mavness & CIVILIZATION

tion, “seizing upon the colon and upon the region which is
below the heart cavity, causes there an insupportable pain
which resembles the iliac affection.” Should it rise still
higher, the disease attacks “the vital parts and causes so
violent a palpitation of the heart that the sick person does
not doubt that his attendants must be able to hear the
sound his heart makes as it beats against his ribs,” Finally, if
it attacks “the exterior part of the head, between the
cranium and the pericranium, and there remains fixed in a
single spot, it causes an extreme pain that is accompanied
by violent fits of vomiting.”"* Each part of the body de-
termines in its own right and by its own nature the form of
the symptom produced. Hysteria thus appears as the most
real and the most deceptive of diseases; real because it is
based upon a movement of the animal spirits; illusory as
well, because it generates symptoms that seem provoked by
a disorder inherent in the organs, whereas they are only the
formation, at the level of these organs, of a central or
rather general disorder; it is the derangement of internal
mobility that assumes the appearance, on the body’s sur-
face, of a local symptom. Actually suffering from the dis-
ordered and excessive movement of spirits, the organ imi-
tates its own illness; starting from a defect in the movement
within internal space, it imitates a disorder that strictly be-
longs to itself; in this manner, hysteria “imitates almost all
the maladies to which human flesh is subject, for in what- .
ever part of the body it lodges, it immediately produces the
symptoms that are proper to that part, and if the physician
does not have great wisdom and experience, he will easily
be deceived and will attribute to an illness essential and
proper to such and such a part, symptoms that are entirely
the result of hysterical affection”:’® stratagems of a disease
that, traversing corporeal space in the homogenous form of
movement, manifests itself in specific aspects; but the type,
here, is not essence; it is a ruse of the body.

(748)
 Aspects of Madness

The more easily penetrable the internal space becomes,
the more frequent is hysteria and the more various its as-
pects; but if the body is firm and resistant, if internal space
is dense, organized, and solidly heterogeneous in its differ-
ent regions, the symptoms of hysteria are rare and its
effects will remain simple. Is this not exactly what separates
female hysteria from the male variety, or, if you will, hys-
teria from hypochondria? Neither symptoms, in fact, nor
even causes form the principle of separation between the
diseases, but only the spatial solidarity of the body, and so
to speak the density of the interior landscape: “Beyond
what we may call the exterior man, who is composed of
parts which are visible to the senses, there is an interior man
formed of a system of animal spirits, a man who can be seen
only with the eyes of the mind. This latter man, closely
_ joined and so to speak united with the corporeal constitu-
tion, is more or less deranged from his state to the degree
that the principles which form the machine have a natural
firmness, That is why this disease attacks women more than
men, because they have a more delicate, less firm constitu-
tion, because they lead a softer life, and because they are
accustomed to the luxuries and commodities of life and not
to suffering.” And already, in the lines of this text, this
spatial density yields one of its meanings: it is also a moral
density; the resistance of the organs to the disordered pene-
tration of the spirits is perhaps one and the same thing as
that strength of soul which keeps the thoughts and the
desires in order. This internal space which has become
permeable and porous is perhaps only the laxity of the
heart. Which explains why so few women are hysterical
when they are accustomed to a hard and laborious life, yet
strongly incline to become so when they lead a soft, idle,
luxurious, and Jax existence; or if some sorrow manages to
conquer their resolution: “When women consult me about
some complaint whose nature I cannot determine, I ask if

(149)

 
 Mavness & CIVILIZATION

the malady from which they are suffering attacks them
only when they have some sorrow . . . : if they admit as
much, I am fully assured that their complaint is an hyster-
ical affection.”*

Thus we have a new formulation of the old moral intui-
tion that from the time of Hippocrates and Plato had made
the womb a living and perpetually mobile animal, and dis-
tributed the spatial ordering of its movements; this intuition
perceived in hysteria the incoercible agitation of desires in
those who had neither the possibility of satisfying them nor
the strength to master them; the image of the female organ
rising to the breast and to the head gave a mythical expres-
sion to an upheaval in the great Platonic tripartition and in
the hierarchy that was intended to assure its immobility.
For Sydenham, for the disciples of Descartes, the moral
intuition is identical; but the spatial landscape in which it is
expressed has changed; Plato's vertical and hieratic order is
replaced by 2 volume which is traversed by incessant mo-
tion whose disorder is no longer a revolution of the depths
to the heights but a lawless whirlwind in a chaotic space.
This “interior body” which Sydenham tried to penetrate
with “the eyes of the mind” was not the objective body
available to the dull gaze of a neutralized observation; it
was the site where a certain manner of imagining the body
and of deciphering its internal movements combined with a
certain manner of investing it with moral values. The
development is completed, the work done on the level of
this ethical perception. In this perception the ever pliant
images of medical theory are inflected and altered; in it,
too, the great moral themes are formulated and gradually
alter their initial aspect.

This penetrable body must, however, be a continuous
body. The dispersion of the disease through the organs is
only the reverse of 2 movement of propagation which per-

(150)

 
 Aspects of Madness

mits it to pass from one to another and to affect them all in
succession. If the body of the hypochondriac or the hys-
teric is a porous body, separated from itself, distended by
the invasion of disease, this invasion can be effected only by
means of a certain spatial continuity. The body in which
the disease circulates must have other properties than the
body in which the sufferer’s dispersed symptoms appear.

The problem haunted eighteenth-century medicine, and
was to make hypochondria and hysteria diseases of the
“nervous type”; that is, idiopathic diseases of the general
agency of all the sympathies.

The nervous fiber is endowed with remarkable’ proper-
ties, which permit it to integrate the most heterogeneous
elements. Is it not astonishing that, responsible for trans-
mitting the most diverse impressions, the nerves should be
of the same nature everywhere, and in every organ? “The
nerve whose expansion at the back of the eye makes it
possible to receive the impression of so subtle a matter as
light; the nerve which, in the organ of hearing, becomes
sensitive to the vibrations of sonorous bodies, differs no
whit in nature from those which serve the grosser sensa~
tions such as touch, taste, and odor.” This identity of na-
ture, in different functions, assures the possibility of com-
munication between the most distant organs, and those
most dissimilar physiologically: “This homogeneity in che
nerves of the animal, combined with the numerous com-
munications that all maintain with each other . . . estab-
lishes among the organs a harmony that often makes one or
several parts participate in the affections of those which
are injured.”*” But what is still more admirable, a nervous
fiber can transmit simultaneously the stimulus of a volun-
tary movement and the impression left on the organ by the
senses. Simon-André Tissot conceived this double function
of one and the same fiber as the combination of an undula-
tory movement for voluntary stimulus (“this is the move-

(rsr)

 
 Mapness & CiVILIZATION

ment of a fluid enclosed in a malleable container, in a
bladder, for example, that when I press it would eject
liquid through a tube”) and a corpuscular movement for
sensation (“this is the movement of a succession of ivory
balls”). Thus sensation and movement can be produced at
the same time in the same nerve: any tension and any re-
laxation in the fiber will alter both movements and sensa-
tions, as we can observe in all nervous diseases.

And yet, despite all these unifying virtues of the nervous
system, is it certain that we can explain, by the real net-
work of its fibers, the cohesion of such diverse disorders as
those which characterize hysteria or hypochondria? How
conceive the liaison among the signs that from one part of
the body to the other betray the presence of a nervous affec-
tion? How explain, and by tracing what line of connection,
that in certain “delicate and highly sensitive” women a
heady perfume or the too vivid description of a tragic
event or even the sight of a combat produces such an im-
pression that they “fall into syncopes or suffer convul-
sions”? One seeks in vain: no precise liaison of the nerves;
no path proceeding from the original cause; but only a
remote, indirect action which is rather on the order of a
physiological solidarity. This is because the different parts
of the body possess a “very determined faculty, which is
either general and extends throughout the entire system of
animal economy, or particular and influences certain parts
principally.” This very distinct property of both “the
faculty of feeling and that of moving” which permits the
organs to communicate with each other and to suffer to-
gether, to react to a stimulus, however distant—is sym-
pathy. As a matter of fact, Whytt succeeded neither in
isolating sympathy in the ensemble of the nervous system,
nor in defining it in relation to sensibility and to movement,
Sympathy exists in the organs only insofar as it is received
there through the intermediary of the nerves; it is the more

(75a)

 
  

Aspects of Madness

marked in proportion to their mobility, and at the same
time it is one of the forms of sensibility: “All sympathy, all
consensus presupposes sentiment and consequently can ex-
ist only by the mediation of the nerves, which are the only
instruments by which sensation operates.”/* But the ner-
vous system is no longer invoked here to explain the exact
transmission of a movement or 2 sensation, but to justify, in
its totality and its mass, the body’s sensibility with regard
to its own phenomena, and its own echo across the volumes
of its organic space.

Diseases of the nerves are essentially disorders of sym-
pathy; they presuppose a state of general vigilance in the
nervous system which makes each organ susceptible of en-
tering into sympathy with any other: “In such a state of
sensibility of the nervous system, the passions of the soul,
violations of diet, sudden alternation of heat and cold or of
heaviness and humidity of the atmosphere, will very readily
produce morbific symptoms; so that with such a constitu-
tion, one will not enjoy steady or constant health, but gen-
erally suffer a continual succession of more or less severe
pains.” Doubtless this exaggerated sensibility is compen-
sated by zones of insensibility, of sleep, as it were; in a
general way, hysterical sufferers are those in whom this
internal sensibility is the most exquisite, hypochondriacs
possessing it, on the contrary, in a relatively blunted form.
And of course women belong to the first category: is not
the womb, with the brain, the organ that maintains most
sympathy with the whole organism? It suffices to cite “the
vomiting that generally accompanies the inflammation of
the womb; the nausea, the disordered appetite that follow
conception; the constriction of the diaphragm and of the
muscles of the abdomen during childbirth; the headache,
the heat and the pains in the back, the intestinal colic
suffered when the time of the menstrual flow approaches.”
The entire female body is riddled by obscure but strangely

(153)

 
  

Mavuness & CIVILIZATION

direct paths of sympathy; it is always in an immediate com-
plicity with itself, to the point of forming a kind of abso-
lutely privileged site for the sympathies; from one extrem~
ity of its organic space to the other, it encloses a perpetual
possibility of hysteria. The sympathetic sensibility of her
organism, radiating through her entire body, condemns
woman to those diseases of the nerves that are called va-
pors. “The women whose systems have generally more
mobility than those of men are more subject to nervous
diseases, which are also more serious in them.” And
Whytt assures us he has witnessed that “the pain of a
toothache caused convulsions in a young girl whose nerves
were weak, and an unconsciousness lasting several hours
and returning when the pain became more acute.”

Diseases of the nerves are diseases of corporeal continu-
ity. A body too close to itself, too intimate in each of its
parts, an organic space which is, in a sense, strangely con-
stricted: this is what the theme common to hysteria and
hypochondria has now become; the rapprochement of the
body with itself assumes, for some, the aspect of a precise—
all too precise—image: such is the celebrated “shriveling of
the nervous system” described by Pomme. Such image:
mask the problem, but do not suppress it, and do not keer
the enterprise from continuing.

Is this sympathy, basically, a property hidden in each
organ—that “sentiment” which Cheyne spoke of—or a real
propagation through an intermediary element? And is the
pathological proximity which characterizes these nervout
diseases an exasperation of this sentiment, or a greatel
mobility of this interstitial body?

Ir is a curious but doubtless characteristic phenomenot
of medical thought in the eighteenth century, in the perioc
when physiologists tried to define most precisely the func.
tions and the role of the nervous system (sensibility anc

(i154)

 
  Aspects of Madness

irritability; sensation and movement), that physicians used
these ideas indiscriminately in the undifferentiated unity of
pathological perception, articulating them according to 2
schema entirely different from that proposed by physiol-

 EScasibility and movement are not distinguished. Tissot
explains thar the child has more sensibiliry than anyone else
because in him everything is lighter and more mobile; ir-
nitability, in the sense in which Haller understood a prop-
erty of the nervous fiber, is identified with irritation, un-
derstood as the pathological state of an organ aroused by a
prolonged stimulus. It would thus be acknowledged that
nervous diseases were states of irritation combined with an
excessive mobility of the fibers.

“On occasion one sees persons for whom the smallest
moving cause occasions much more movement than it pro-
duces in healthy persons; they cannot sustain the slight-
est alien impression. The faintest sound, the weakest light
affords them extraordinary symptoms.”?° By this deliber-
ately preserved ambiguity in the notion of irritation, med-
icine at the end of the eighteenth century could in effect
show the continuity between disposition (irritability) and
the pathological event (irritation); but it could also main-
tain both the theme of a disorder proper to an organ which
suffers, but in a fashion all its own, 2 general attack (it is
the sensibility particular to the organ which assures this
nonetheless discontinuous communication), and the idea of
a propagation in the organism of a single disorder that can
attack it in each of its parts (it is the mobility of the fiber
which is responsible for this continuity, despite the diverse
forms it assumes in the organs).

But if the notion of “irritated fiber” certainly plays this
role of concerted confusion, it also permits a decisive dis-
tinction in pathology, On one hand, nervous sufferers are
the most irritable, that is, have the most sensibility: tenu-

(iss)
  

Mavness & CIVILIZATION

ousness of fiber, delicacy of organism; but they also have
an easily impressionable soul, an unquiet heart, too strong a
sympathy for what happens around them. This sort of uni-
versal resonance—simultaneously sensation and mobility—
constitutes the first determination of the illness. Women
who have “frail fibers,” who are easily carried away, in
their idleness, by the lively movements of their imagination,
are more often attacked by nervous diseases than men who
are “more robust, drier, hardened by work.” Buc this excess
of irritation has this peculiarity: that in its vivacity it at-
tenuates, and sometimes ends by extinguishing, the sensa-
tions of the soul; as if the sensibility of the nervous organ
itself overcharged the soul’s capacity to feel, and appropri-
ated for its own advantage the multiplicity of sensations
aroused by its extreme mobility; the nervous system “is in
such a state of irritation and reaction that it is then inca-
pable of transmitting to the soul what ir is experiencing; all
its figures are disordered; it can no longer interpret
them.”?! Thus appears the idea of a sensibility which is not
sensation, and of an inverse relation between that delicacy
which derives as much from the soul as from the body, and
a certain numbness of the sensations that prevents nervous
shocks from reaching the soul. The hysteric’s unconscious-
ness is only the reverse of his sensibility. It is this relation,
which the notion of sympathy could not define, which was
contributed by the concept of irritability, though so little
elaborated and still so confused in the thinking of pathol-

But by this very fact, the moral significance of “nervous
complaints” was profoundly altered. Insofar as diseases of
the nerves had been associated with the organic movements
of the lower parts of the body (even by the many and
confused paths of sympathy), they were located within a
certain ethic of desire: they represented the revenge of a
crnde body; it had been as-the resule of an excessive vio-

(rs56)

lence that one became ill. From now on one fell ill from too
much feeling; one suffered from an excessive solidarity
with all the beings around one. One was no longer com-
pelled by one’s secret nature; one was the victim of every-
thing which, on the surface of the world, solicited the body
and the soul.

And as a result, one was both more innocent and more
guilty. More innocent, because one was swept by the total
irritation of the nervous system into an unconsciousness
great in proportion to one’s disease. But more guilty, much
more guilty, because everything to which one was attached
in the world, the life one had led, the affections one had
had, the passions and the imaginations one had cultivated
too complacently--all combined in the irritation of the
nerves, finding there both their natural effect and their
moral punishment. All life was finally judged by this degree
of irritation: abuse of things that were not natural, the sed-
entary life of cities, novel reading, theatergoing, immoder-
ate thirst for knowledge, “too fierce a passion for the sex, or
that other criminal habit, as morally reprehensible as it is
physically harmful.”** The innocence of the nervous suf-
ferer, who no longer even feels the irritation of his nerves,
is at bottom only the just punishment of a deeper guile: the
guilt which makes him prefer the world to nature: “Terrible
state! .. . This is the torment of all effeminate souls
whom inaction has plunged into dangerous sensuality, and
who, to rid themselves of the labors imposed by nature,
have embraced all the phantoms of opinion. . . . Thus the
rich are punished for the deplorable use of their fortune.”

We stand here on the threshold of the nineteenth cen-
tary, where the irritability of the fibers will enjoy physio-
logical and pathological fortunes. What it leaves for the
moment, in the domain of nervous diseases, is nonetheless
something very important.

This is, on the one hand, the complete identification of

(257)
  

Maovness & CIVILIZATION

hysteria and hypochondria as mental diseases. By the cap-
ital distinction between sensibility and sensation, they enter
into that domain of unreason which we have seen was char-
acterized by the essential moment of error and dream, that
is, of blindness. As long as vapors were convulsions or
strange sympathetic communications through the body,
even when they led to fainting and loss of consciousness,
they were not madness. But once the mind becomes blind
through the very excess of sensibilicy—then madness ap-
pears.

But on the other hand, such an identification gives mad-
ness 2 new content of guilt, of moral sanction, of just pun-
ishment which was not at all a part of the classical experi-
ence, It burdens unreason with all these new values: instead
of making blindness the condition of possibility for all the
manifestations of madness, it describes blindness, the
blindness of madness, as the psychological effect of a moral
fault. And thereby compromises what had been essential
in the experience of unreason. What had been blindness
would become unconsciousness, what had been error
would become fault, and everything in madness that desig-
nated the paradoxical manifestation of non-being would
become the natural punishment of a moral evil. In short,
that whole vertical hierarchy which constituted the struc-
ture of classical madness, from the cycle of material causes
to the transcendence of delirium, would now collapse and
spread over the surface of a domain which psychology and
morality would soon occupy together and contest with
each other.

The “scientific psychiatry” of the nineteenth century
became possible.

Tt was in these “diseases of the nerves” and in these
“hysterias,” which would soon provoke its irony, that this
psychiatry took its origin.

DOCTORS AND
PATIENTS

Tue therapeutics of madness did not function in the hos-
pital, whose chief concern was to sever or to “correct.”
And yet in the non-hospital domain, treatment continued
to develop throughout the classical period: long cures for
madness were elaborated whose aim was not so much to
care for the soul as to cure the entire individual, his nervous
fiber as well as the course of his imagination. The mad~-
man’s body was regarded as the visible and solid presence of
his disease: whence those physical cures whose meaning
was borrowed from a moral perception and a moral thera-
peutics of the body.

1. Consolidation. There exists in madness, even in its
most agitated forms, an element of weakness. If in madness
the spirits are subjected to irregular movements, it is be-
cause they have not enough strength or weight to follow
the gravity of their natural course; if spasms and convul-

(zs9)

 
 Mavness & CIVILIZATION

sions so often occur in nervous illnesses, it is because the
fiber is too mobile, or too irritable, or too sensitive to vibra-
tions; in any case, it lacks robusmess. Beneath the apparent
violence of madness, which sometimes seems to multiply
the strength of maniacs to considerable proportions, there
is always a secret weakness, an essential lack of resistance;
the madman’s frenzies, in fact, are only a passive vio-
lence. What is wanted, then, is a cure that will give the
spirits or the fibers a vigor, but a calm vigor, a strength no
disorder can mobilize, since from the start it will be subject
to the course of natural law. More than the image of vi-
vacity and vigor, it is one of robustness that prevails, envel-
oping the theme in a new resistance, a young elasticity, but
subjugated and already domesticated. A force must be
found within nature to reinforce nature itself.

The ideal remedy would “take the part” of the spirits,
and “help them conquer the cause that ferments them.” To
take the part of the spirits would be to struggle against the
vain agitation to which they are subject in spite of them-
selves; it would also permit them to escape from all the
chemical ebullition that heats and troubles them; finally it
would give them enough solidity to resist the vapors that
try to suffocate them, to make them inert, and to carry
them off in their whirlwind. Against the vapors, the spirits
are reinforced “by the most stinking odors”; disagreeable
sensation vivifies the spirits, which in a sense rebel and
vigorously flock to the place where the assault must
be repelled; to this effect “asafetida, oil of amber, burnt
leather and feathers will be used—that is, whatever can
provide the soul with strong and disagreeable feelings.”
Against fermentation, theriac must be given, “anti-epileptic
spirits of Charras,” or best of all, the famous Queen of
Hungary water;? acidity disappears and the spirits regain
their true influence. Finally, to restore their true mobilicy,
Lange recommends that the spirits be subjected to sensa-

(160)

 
 Doctors and Patients

tions and movements that are both agreeable, measured,
and regular: “When the animal spirits are dispersed and
disunited, remedies are necessary which calm their move-
ment and return them to their natural situation, such things
as give the soul a sweet and moderate feeling of pleasure:
agreeable odors, walks in delightful spots, the sight of per-
sons who are in the habit of providing diversion, and
Music.” This firm gentleness, a proper gravity, ultimately a
vivacity intended only to protect the body—all these are
means to consolidate, within the organism, the fragile ele-
ments connecting body and soul.

But there is probably no better fortifying procedure
than the use of the substance which is both the most solid
and the most docile, the most resistant but the most pliable
in the hands of the man who knows how to forge it to his
purposes; iron. Iron unites, in its privileged nature, all chose
qualities that quickly become contradictory when they are
isolated, Nothing resists better, nothing can better obey; it
is a gift of nature, but it is also at the disposal of all of man’s
techniques, How could man help nature and lend it an
abundance of strength by a surer means—that is, one closer
to nature and more obedient to man—than by the applica-
tion of iron? The old example of Dioscorides is always
cited, who gave to the inertia of water the vigorous virtues
foreign to it by plunging into it a bar of red-hot iron. The
ardor of fire, the calm mobility of water, the rigor of a
metal treated until it had become supple—all these ele-
ments, united, conferred upon water powers of reinforce-
ent, of vivification, of consolidation, which it could trans-
mit to the organism. But iron is efficacious even aside from
any preparation; Sydenham recommends it in its simplest
form, by the direct absorption of iron filings. Whytt in-
stances a man who, in order to cure himself of a weakness
of the stomach nerves involving a permanent state of hypo-
chondria, took 230 grains of iron every day. This was

(1671)

 
 MADNESS & CIVILIZATION

because to all its virtues, iron added the remarkable prop-
erty of transmitting itself directly, without intermediary or
transformation. What it communicated was not its sub-
stance but its strength; paradoxically, though itself so re~
sistant, it immediately dissolved in the organism, depositing
there only its qualities, without rust or waste. It is evident
here that an imagery of wonder-working iron governs dis-
cursive thought and prevails over observation itself. If
experiments were made, it was not to reveal a positive se-
quence of effects, but to emphasize this immediate com-
munication of qualities. Wright fed a dog Mars salts; he
observed that an hour later the chyle, if mixed with tinc-
ture of nut gall, did not display that purple color it invari-
ably assumed if the iron had been absorbed. This must have
been because the iron, without mixing with the diges-
tion, without passing into the blood, without penetrating
the organism substantially, fortified the membranes and
fibers directly. More than an observed effect, the consolida-
tion of the spirits and the nerves appears rather as an opera-
tive metaphor which implies a transfer of strength without
any discursive dynamics, Strength is supplied by contact,
exclusive of any exchange or substance, any communication
of movements.

2. Purification, Clogging of the viscera, ebullition of
false ideas, fermentation of vapors, violence, corruption of
liquids and spirits—madness elicits an entire series of thera-
peutics, each of which can be attached to the identical
operation of purification.

The ideal was a sort of total purification: the simplest
but also the most impossible of cures. It would consist of
substituting for the melancholic’s overcharged, thick blood,
encumbered with bitter humors, a light, clear blood whose
new movement would dissipate the delirium. In 1662 Mo-
ritz Hoffman suggested blood transfusion as a remedy for
melancholia. Some years later, the idea had attained suffi-

(162)

 
 Doctors and Patients

cient currency for the Philosophical Society of London to
plan a series of experiments upon the subjects confined in
Bedlam; Allen, the doctor entrusted with the enterprise,
refused, But Jean-Baptiste Denis tried it upon one of his
patients stricken with amorous melancholia; he drew off
ten ounces of blood, which he replaced with a slightly
smaller quantity taken from the femoral artery of a calf;
the following day he began again, but this time the opera-
tion involved only a few ounces. The patient became calm;
the following day his mind cleared; he was soon entirely
cured; “all the professors of the Academy of Surgeons at-
tested it.” The technique, however, was quickly aban-
doned, despite a few later attempts.

The preferred medications were those that forestalled
corruption. We know “as a result of more than three thou-
sand years of experience that Myrrh and Aloes preserve
corpses.” Are not these deteriorations of bodies of the
same nature as those that accompany the diseases of the
humors? Then nothing would be more recommendable
against the vapors than products like myrrh or aloes, and
especially the famous elixir of Paracelsus. But more must be
attempted than to forestall corruptions; they must be de-
stroyed. Whence the therapeutics that attack deterioration
itself, and seek either to deflect the corrupt substances or to
dissolve the corrupting ones: techniques of deflection and
techniques of detersion.

To the first belong all the strictly physical methods chat
seek to create wounds or sores on the surface of the body,
both centers of infection that relieve the organism, and cen-
ters of evacuation into the outside world, Thus Fallowes
explains the beneficial mechanism of his olewm cephalicum;
in madness, “black vapors clog the very fine vessels
through which the animal spirits must pass”; the blood is
thus deprived of direction; it encumbers the veins of the
brain where it stagnates, unless it is agitated by a confused

(163)

 
 Mavwness & CIVILIZATION

movement “that distracts the ideas.” Olewm cephalicum has
the advantage of provoking “little pustules on the head”;
they are anointed with oil to keep them from drying out
and so that “the black vapors lodged in the brain” may
continue to escape. But buming and cauterizing the body
at any point produces the same effect. It was even supposed
that diseases of the skin such as scabies, eczema, or smallpox
could put an end to a fit of madness; the corruption then
left the viscera and the brain, to spread on the surface of
the body, where it was released externally. By the end of
the century, it became customary to inoculate scabies in the
most resistant cases of mania. In his Instructions of 1785,
addressed to the directors of hospitals, Frangois Doublet
recommends that if bleedings, purges, baths, and showers
do not cure mania, the use of “cauters, setons, superficial
abscesses, inoculation of scabies” will.

But the principal task is to dissolve the fermentations
which, having formed in the body, give rise to madness. To
accomplish this, the chief agent is bitters, Bitterness has all
the harsh virtues of sea water; it purifies by wearing away,
it works its corrosion on everything useless, unhealthy, and
impure that the disease may have deposited in the body and
the soul. Bitter and active, coffee is useful for “fat persons
whose thickened humors circulate with difficulty”; it dries
without burning—for it is the property of such substances
to dissipate superfluous humidity without dangerous heat;
there is in coffee, as it were, fire without flame, a purifying
power that does not calcine; coffee reduces impurities:
“those who take it feel by long experience that it restores
the stomach, consumes its superfluous humidity, dissipates
wind, dissolves the phlegm of the bowels, where it per-
forms a mild abstersion, and what is most considerable,
prevents the fumes from rising to the head and conse-
quently reduces the aches and pains customarily suffered

“ STULTIFERA
N AVIS”

Ar the end of the Middle Ages, leprosy disappeared from
the Western world. In the margins of the community, at
the gates of cities, there stretched wastelands which sick-
ness had ceased to haunt but had left sterile and long un-
inhabitable. For centuries, these reaches would belong to
the non-human. From the fourteenth to the seventeenth
century, they would wait, soliciting with strange incanta-
tions a new incarnation of disease, another grimace of ter-
ror, renewed rites of purification and exclusion.

From the High Middle Ages to the end of the Crusades,
leprosariums had multiplied their cities of the damned over
the entire face of Europe. According to Mathieu Paris,
there were as many as 19,000 of them throughout Christen-
dom. In any case, around 1226, when Louis VIII estab-
lished the lazar-house law for France, more than 2,000
appeared on the official registers. There were 43 in the

there; finally, it affords strength, vigor, and cleanliness to
the animal spirits, without leaving any great impression of
heat, even upon the most inured persons who are accus-
tomed to use it.”® Bitter, but tonic also, is the quinine
Whytt freely prescribes to persons “whose nervous system
is very delicate”; it is efficacious against “weakness, dis-
couragement, and depression”; two years of a cure consist-
ing only of a tincture of quinine, “occasionally discontin-
ued for a month at most,” were sufficient to cure a woman
suffering from a nervous complaint. For delicate persons,
quinine must be associated with “a bitterness pleasant to the
taste”; but if the organism is able to withstand stronger
attacks, vitriol, mixed with quinine, cannot be too strongly
recommended, Twenty or thirty drops of elixir of vitriol
are sovereign.

Quite naturally, soaps and soap products inevitably en-
joy privileged effects in this purificatory enterprise. “Soap
dissolves almost anything that is concrete.’* Tissot believes
that soap can be consumed directly, and that it will calm
many nervous ailments; but more often it is sufficient to
consume, first thing in the morning, by themselves or with
bread, “soapy fruits’—that is, cherries, strawberries, cur-
rants, figs, oranges, grapes, ripe pears, and “other fruits of
this nature.” But there are cases where the difficulty is so
serious, the obstruction so irreducible, that no soap can
conquer it. Soluble tartar is then recommended. Muzzell
was the first to have the idea of prescribing tartar for “mad-
ness and melancholia,” and published several. triumphant
observations on the subject. Whytt confirms them, and
shows at rhe same time that tartar functions as a detersive,
since it is especially efficacious against obstructive illnesses:
“Insofar as I have observed it, soluble tartar is more useful in
maniac or melancholic affections produced by harmful
humors amassed in the primary canals, than for those pro-

(165)

duced by a flaw in the brain.” Among the dissolvants,
Raulin also cites honey, chimney soot, Oriental saffron,
wood lice, powdered lobster claw, and bezoar.

Halfway between these internal methods of dissolution
and the external techniques of deflection, we find a series of
practices of which the most frequent are applications of
vinegar. As an acid, vinegar dissolves obstructions, destroys
foreign bodies as they are fermenting. But in external ap-
plication, it can serve as a revulsive, and draw harmful
humors and liquids to the surface. It is curious but quite

’ characteristic of the therapeutic thinking of this period
that no contradiction was admitted between thése two
modes of action. Given what it is by nature—detersive and
revulsive—vinegar would act in any situation according to
this double determination, even though one of these two
modes of action can no longer be analyzed in a rational and
discursive fashion. It functions, then, directly, without in-
termediary, through the simple contact of two natural ele-
ments, Hence it is recommended to rub the head, shaved if
possible, with vinegar. The Gazette de médecine cites the
case of an empiric who managed to cure “a quantity of
madmen by a very swift and very simple means. Here is his
secret, After he has purged them above and below, he has
them soak their head and hands in vinegar, and leaves them
in this situation until they fall asleep, or rather until they
wake up, and most of them are cured upon waking. He also
applies to the patient’s shaved head chopped leaves of Dip-
sacus, or fuller’s weed.”

3- lmmersion. Here two themes intersect: the theme of
ablution, with all that relates it to the rites of purity and
rebirth; and the much more physiological theme of im-
pregnation or immersion, which modifies the essential qual-
ities of liquids and solids. Despite their differenc origin, and
the gap between their levels of conceptual elaboration, they
form, up to the end of the eighteenth century, a unity

(166)

 
 Doctors and Patients

coherent enough so that their opposition is not experienced
as such. The idea of nature, with its ambiguities, serves as
their element of cohesion. Water, the simple and primitive
liquid, belongs to all that is purest in nacure; all the dubious
modifications man has been able to add to nature’s essential
kindness cannot change the beneficence of water; when
civilization, life in society, the imaginary desires aroused by
novel reading and theatergoing provoke nervous ailments,
the rerurn to water’s limpidity assumes the meaning of a
ritual of purification; in that transparent coolness, one is
reborn to one’s first innocence. But at the same time, the
water naturally inherent in the composition of all bodies
restores each to its own equilibrium; water serves as a
universal physiological regulator. All these themes were
expressed by Tissot, a disciple of Rousseau, whose imagina-
tion was as moral as it was medical: “Nature has prescribed
water as the unique beverage of all nations; she gave it the
power to dissolve all sorts of nourishment; it is agreeable to
the palate; choose therefore a good cold water, fresh and
light; it fortifies and cleans the bowels; the Greeks and
Romans regarded it as a universal remedy.”

The practice of immersion reaches far back into the his-
tory of madness; the baths taken at Epidaurus alone would
bear witness to this; and cold applications of all kinds must
have been current throughout antiquity, since Soranus of
Ephesus, if we are to believe Caelius Aurelianus, already
protested against their abuse. In the Middle Ages, the tra-
ditional treatment of a maniac was to plunge him several
times into water “until he had lost his strength and forgot-
ten his fury.” Franciscus Sylvius recommends immersions
in cases of melancholia or frenzy. And the story, accepted
in the eighteenth century, of Van Helmont’s sudden dis-
covery of the usefulness of hydrotherapy, was actually a
reinterpretation. According to Menuret, this invention,
supposedly dating from the middle of the seventeenth cen-

(267)

 
 Mavness & CivILIZATION

tury, was the fortunate result of chance: a heavily chained
madman was being transported on an open wagon; he man-
aged, however, to free himself from his chains and jumped
into a lake, tried to swim, fainred,; when he was rescued,
everyone thought he was dead, but he quickly recovered
his spirits, which were abruptly restored to their natural
order, and he “lived a long time without experiencing any
further attack of madness.” This anecdote supposedly en-
lightened Van Helmont, who began to plunge the insane
indiscriminately into the sea or into fresh water; “the only
care that must be taken, is to plunge the sufferers into the
water suddenly and unawares, and to keep them there for a
Jong time. One need have no fear for their lives.” -

The trath of the story is of little importance; one thing is
certain, which it conveys in the form of an anecdote: from
the end of the seventeenth century, the water cure takes or
regains its place as a major therapeutics of madness. When
Doubler published his Instructions shortly before the Rev-
olution, he prescribed, for the four major pathological
forms he recognized (frenzy, mania, melancholia, imbecil-
ity), the regular use of baths, adding the use of cold show-
ers for the first two. And at this period, Cheyne had
already long since recommended that “all those who need
to fortify their temperament” install baths in their house,
and use them every two, three, or four days; or “if they
have not the means, to bathe in some manner either in a lake
or in running water, whenever they have occasion.”

The advantages of water are evident, to 2 medicine
dominated by the concern to equilibrate liquids and solids.
For if water has powers of impregnation, which place it
first among the humectants, it has, insofar as it can receive
supplementary qualities like cold and heat, the virtues of
constriction, of cooling or of heating, and it can even have
those effects of consolidation attributed to substances like
iron. In fact, the interplay of qualities is very labile, in the

(168)

 
 Doctors and Patients

fluid substance of water; just as it penetrates easily into the
web of all the tissues, it may be easily impregnated by all
the qualitative influences to which it is subjected. Paradox-
ically, its universal use in the eighteenth century was not
the result of a general recognition of its effect and mode of
action, but of the ease with which the most contradictory
forms and modalities could be attributed to its action. It is |
the locus of all possible therapeutic themes, forming an in-
exhaustible reservoir of operative metaphors. In this fluid
element occurs the universal exchange of qualities,

Of course, cold water cools. Otherwise would it be used
in frenzy and mania—diseases of heat, in which che spirits
boil, solids stretch, liquids seethe to the point of evapora-
tion, leaving the brains of these sufferers “dry and fragile,”
as anatomy can daily testify? Reasonably enough, Barthél-
emy-Camille Boissieu cites cold water among the essential
means of cooling cures; as a bath, it comes first among the
“antiphlogistics” which tear from the body the excessive
igneous particles found there; as a drink, it is a “procrasti-
native dilution” which diminishes the resistance of fluids to
the actions of solids, and thus indirectly lowers the general
heat of the body.

But it can just as well be said that cold water heats and
hot water cools. It is precisely this thesis which Daruc de-
fends. Cold baths attack the blood that is at the periphery
of the body and “drive it more vigorously toward the
heart.” But the heart being the seat of natural heat, there
the blood is heated, especially because “the heart, which
struggles alone against the other parts, makes new efforts to
drive out the blood and to overcome the resistance of the
capillaries. Whence a great intensity of circulation, the di-
vision of the blood, the fluidity of the humors, the destruc-
tion of the encumbrances, the augmentation of the forces
of natural heat, of the appetite of the digestive forces, of
the activity of the body and the mind.” The paradox of the

(169)

 
 Maovness & CIVILIZATION

hot bath is symmetrical: it draws the blood to the periph-
ery, as well as the humors, perspiration, and all liquids,
useful or harmful. Thus the vital centers are relieved; the
heart now must function slowly; and the organism is
thereby cooled. Is not this fact confirmed by “those syn-
copes, those lipothymias, that weakness, that lack of vigor”
which accompany the too constant use of hot baths?
Further still: so rich is water's polyvalence, so great its
aptitude for submitting to the qualities it bears, that it even
manages to lose its efficacity as a liquid, and to act as a
desiccant. Water can conjure away humidity. It revives the
old principle “like to like,” but in another sense, and by the
intermediary of an entire visible mechanism. For some, it is
cold water that dries, heat on the contrary preserving
water’s humidiry. Heat, in fact, dilates the pores of the
organism, distends its membranes, and permits humidity to
impregnate them by a secondary effect. Heat clears the
way for liquids. It is precisely for this reason that all the
hot drinks the seventeenth century used and abused risk
becoming harmful: relaxation, general humidiry, softness
of the entire organism—this is what threatens those who
consume too many such infusions. And since these are the
distinctive traits of the female body, as opposed to virile
dryness and solidity, the abuse of hot drinks risks leading to
a general feminization of the human race: “Most men are
censured, not without reason, for having degenerated in
contracting the softness, the habits, and the inclinations of
women; there is lacking only a resemblance in bodily con-
stitution. Excessive use of humectants immediately acceler-
ates the metamorphosis and makes the two sexes almost as
alike in the physical as in the moral realm. Woe to the
human race, if this prejudice extends its reign co the com-
mon people; there will be no more plowmen, artisans, sol-
diers, for they will soon be robbed of the strength and
vigor necessary to their profession.”* In cold water, it is

(170)

 
 Dactors and Patients

the cold that vanquishes all the powers of humidity, for by
tightening the tissues, it closes them to all possibility of
impregnation: “Do we not see how much the vessels, the
tissues of our flesh tighten when we wash in cold water or
when we are numbed with cold?”* Cold baths thus have
the paradoxical property of consolidating the organism, of
guaranteeing it against the softness of humidity, of “giving
tone to the parts,” as Hoffmann said, “and augmenting the
systaltic power of the heart and the vessels.”

But in other qualitative intuitions, the relationship is re-
versed; here it is heat that dries up water's humectant prop~
erties, while cold ceaselessly preserves and renews them.
Against diseases of the nerves due to “a shriveling of the
nervous system” and “the dryness of the membranes,”
Pomme does not recommend hot baths—which abet the
heat that reigns in the body—but tepid or cold baths that
can permeate the tissues of the organism and restore their
suppleness. Is this not the method spontaneously practiced
in America? And are not its effects, its very mechanism
visible to the naked eye in the development of the cure,
since at the most acute point of the crisis, the sufferers float
in the water of the bath—to such an extent has internal
heat rarified the air and the liquids of their bodies; yet if
they remain a long time in the bath water, “three, four, or
even six hours a day,” then relaxation takes place, the
water gradually impregnates the membranes and the fibers,
the body becomes heavy and sinks naturally to the bottom.

At the end of the eighteenth century, the powers of
water wane in the very excess of its qualitative versatility:
cold, it can heat; hot, it can cool; instead of humidifying, it
is even capable of solidifying, of petrifying by cold, or of
sustaining a fire with its own heat. In it, all the values of
beneficence and maleficence indiscriminately combine. It is
endowed with all possible complicities. In medical thought,
it forms a therapeutic theme which can be used and ma-

(777)

 
 Mavness & CIVILIZATION

nipolated unconditionally, and whose effect can be under-
stood im the most diverse physiologies and pathologies. It
has so many values, so many different modes of action, that
it can confirm anything, cancel anything. No doubt it was
this very polyvalence, with all the disputes it generated,
that finally neutralized water. By Pinel’s day, water was
still used, but ir had again become entirely limpid, its quali-
tative overtones had been eliminated, and its mode of action
could no longer be anything but mechanical.

Showers, hitherto less used than baths and drinks, now
become the favored technique. And paradoxically, water
regains, beyond all the physiological variations of the pre-
ceding epoch, its simple function of purification, The only
quality attributed to it is violence, an irresistible flow wash-
ing away all the impurities that form madness; by its own
curative power, it reduces the individual to his simplest
possible expression, to his merest and purest form of exist-
ence, thus affording him a second birth; it is a matter, Pinel
explains, “of destroying even the smallest traces of the ex- ~
travagant ideas of the insane, which can be done only by
obliterating, so to speak, these ideas in a state close to that
of death.” Whence the famous techniques used in asylums
like Charenton at the end of the eighreenth and the begin-
ning of the nineteenth century: the shower proper—“the
insane man, fastened to an armchair, was placed beneath a
reservoir filled with cold water which poured directly
upon his head through a large pipe”; and surprise baths—
“the sufferer came down the corridors to the ground floor,
and arrived in a square vaulted room, in which a pool had
been constructed; he was pushed over backwards and into
the water.”? Such violence promised the rebirth of 2 bap-
tism.

4+ Regulation of Movement. If it is true that madness is
the irregular agitation of the spiries, the disordered move-
ment of fibers and ideas, it is also obstruction of the body

(172)

 
 Doctors and Patients

and the soul, stagnation of the humors, immobilization of
the fibers in their rigidity, fixation of ideas and attention on
a theme that gradually prevails over all others. Ir is then a
matter of restoring to the mind and to the spirits, to the
body and to the soul, the mobility which gives them life.
This mobility, however, must be measured and controlled;
it must not become a vain agitation of the fibers which no
longer obey the stimuli of the exterior world. The animat-
ing idea of this therapeutic theme is the restitution of a
movement that corresponds to the prudent mobility of the
exterior world. Since madness can be dumb immobility,
obstinate fixation as well as disorder and agitation, the cure
consists in reviving in the sufferer a movement that will be
both regular and real, in the sense that it will obey the rules
of the world’s movements.

Physicians of the period evoke the firm belief of the an-
cients, who attributed salutary effects to various forms of
walking and running: simple walking, which both limbers .
and strengthens the body; running at an ever increasing
speed, which better distributes the juices and humors
throughout the body, at the same time that it diminishes the
weight of the organs; running fully dressed, which heats
and loosens the tissues, softens too rigid fibers. Sydenham
especially recommends horseback riding in cases of melan-
cholia and hypochondria: “But the best thing I have yet
found to fortify and animate the blood and the spirits, is to
tide almost every day, and in this manner to make rather
long excursions in the fresh air. This exercise, by the ex-
traordinary jolting it causes the lungs and especially the
viscera of the lower stomach, rids the blood of the excre-
mental humors that reside there, gives resilience to the
fibers, re-establishes the functions of the organs, reanimates
natural heat, evacuates degenerate juices by perspiration or
other means, or else re-establishes them in their previous
state, dissipates obstructions, opens all passages, and finally,

(173)

 
 Mavness & CIVILIZATION

through the continual movement it causes the blood, re-
news it, so to speak, and accords it an extraor vi-
gor." The rolling of the sea, the most regular, the most
natural movement in the world, and the one most in accord
with cosmic order—that same movement which De Lancre
once considered so dangerous for the human heart, offering
as it did so many hazardous temptations, improbable and
always unfulfilled dreams, constitutive of the image, in
fact, of infinite evil—was considered by the eighteenth cen-
tury as a powerful regulator of organic mobility. In it, the
very rhythm of nature spoke. Gilchrist wrote an entire
treatise “fon the use of sea voyages in Medicine”, Whytt
found the remedy difficult to apply to those subject to
melancholia; it is “difficult to convince such patients to un-
dertake a long sea voyage, but a case must be cited of
hypochondriacal vapors that immediately disappeared in a
young man who was constrained to travel in a ship for four
or five weeks.”

Travel has the additional interest of acting directly upon
the flow of ideas, or at least by 2 more direct means, since it
passes only through the sensations. The variety of the land-
scape dissipates the melancholic’s obstinacy: a remedy in
use since antiquity, but which the eighteenth century pre-
scribed with a new insistence, and whose forms it varied,
from real travel to the imaginary voyages of literature and
the theater. Antoine le Camus prescribes “in order to relax
the brain” in all cases of vaporous affections: “walks, jour-
neys, rides, exercise in the fresh air, dancing, spectacles,
diverting reading, occupations that can cause the obsessive
idea to be forgotten.” The country, by the gentleness and
variety of its landscapes, wins melancholics from their
single obsession “by taking them away from the places that
might revive the memory of their sufferings.”

But inversely, the agitation of mania can be corrected by
the good effects of a regular movement. This is no longer a

(174)

 
  

Maowness & CIVILIZATION

diocese of Paris alone: these included Bourg-le-Reine, Cor-
beil, Saint-Valére, and the sinister Champ-Pourri (Rotten
Field); included also was Charenton. The two largest were
in the immediate vicinity of Paris: Saint-Germain and Saint-
Lazare:* we shall hear their names again in the history of
another sickness, This is because from the fifteenth century
on, all were emptied; in the next century Saint-Germain
became a reformatory for young criminals; and before the
time of Saint Vincent there was only one leper left at Saint-
Lazare, “Sieur Langlois, practitioner in the civil court.”
The lazar house of Nancy, which was among the largest in
Europe, had only four inmates during the regency of Marie
de Médicis. According to Catel’s Mémoires, there were 29
hospitals in Toulouse at the end of the medieval period:
seven were leprosariums; but at the beginning of the seven-
teenth century we find only three mentioned: Saint-Cyp-
rien, Arnaud-Bernard, and Saint-Michel. It was a pleasure
to celebrate the disappearance of leprosy: in 1635 the in-
habitants of Reims formed a solemn procession to thank
God for having delivered their city from this scourge.

For a century already, royal authority had undertaken
the control and reorganization of the immense fortune
represented by the endowments of the lazar houses; in a
decree of December 19, 1543, Francois I had a census and
inventory taken “to remedy the great disorder that exists at
present in the lazar houses”; in his turn, Henri IV in an
edict of 1606 prescribed a revision of their accounts and
allotted “the sums obtained from this investigation to the
sustenance of poor noblemen and crippled soldiers,” The
same request for regulation is recorded on October 24,
1612, but the excess revenues were now to be used for
feeding the poor.

In fact, the question of the leprosariums was not settled
in France before the end of the seventeenth century; and
the problem’s economic importance provoked more than
one conflict. Were there not still, in the year 1677, 44 lazar

(4)
 Doctors and Patients

restoring of motion but a regulation of agitation, momen-
tarily stopping its course, fixing the attention. Travel is
efficacious not by its incessant breaks in continuity, but by
the novelty of the objects it affords, by the curiosity to
which it gives birth. It should permit the external distrac-
tion of a mind which has escaped all control, and has es-
caped from itself in the vibration of its interior movement.
“Tf one can discover objects or persons who may be able to
distract the attention from the pursuit of deranged ideas
and who may be able to fix it somewhat upon others, they
must be presented often to maniacs; and it is for this reason
that advantages may often be obtained from travel, which
interrupts the sequence of former ideas and offers objects
that fix the attention.”®

Utilized for the changes it affords in melancholia, or for
the regularity it imposes upon mania, the therapeutics of
movement conceals the idea of a seizure by the world of
the alienated mind. It is both a “falling in step” and a con-
version, since movement prescribes its rhythm, but consti-
tutes, by its novelty or variety, 2 constant appeal to the
mind to leave itself and return to the world. If it is true that
the techniques of immersion always concealed the ethical,
almost religious memories of ablution, of a second birth, in
these cures by movement we can also recognize a sym-
metrical moral theme, but one that is the converse of the
first: to return to the world, to entrust oneself to its wis-
dom by returning to one’s place in the. general order of
things, thus forgetting madness, which is the moment of
pure subjectivity. We see how even in empiricism, the
means of cure encounter the great organizing structures of
the experience of madness in the classical period. Being
both error and sin, madness is simultaneously impurity and
solitude; it is withdrawn from the world, and from truth;
but ic is by that very fact imprisoned in evil. Its double
nothingness is to be the visible form of that non-being

(775)

 
 Manvwness & CIVILIZATION

which is evil, and to utter, in the void and in the sensational
appearances of its delirium, the non-being of error. It is
totally pure, since it is nothing if nor the evanescent point
of a subjectivity from which all presence of the truth has
been removed; and totally impure, since this nothingness is
the non-being of evil. The technique of cure, down to its
physical symbols most highly charged with iconographic
intensity—consolidation and return to movement on the
one hand, purification and immersion on the other—is se-
cretly organized around these two fundamental themes: the
. Subject must be restored to his initial purity, and must be
wrested from his pure subjectivity in order to be initiated
into the world; the non-being that alienates him from him-
self must be annihilated, and he must be restored to the
plenitude of the exterior world, to the solid truth of being.

The techniques were to subsist longer than their mean-
ing. When, outside the experience of unreason, madness
had received a purely psychological and moral status, when
the relations of error and fault by which classicism defined
madness were crammed into the single notion of guilt, the
techniques still remained, but with a much more restricted
significance; all that was sought was a mechanical effect, or
a moral punishment. It was in this manner that the meth-
ods of regulating movement degenerated into the famous
“rotatory machine” whose mechanism and efficacity were
demonstrated by Mason Cox at the beginning of the nine-
teenth century:** a perpendicular pillar is attached to both
floor and ceiling; the sufferer is attached to a chair or a bed
hung from a horizontal arm moving around the pillar; by
means of a “not very complicated system of gears” the
machine is set for “the degree of speed desired.” Cox cites
one of his own observations; it concerns a man whom mel-
ancholia had thrown into a kind of stupor: “His complex-
ion was dark and leaden, his eyes yellow, his looks con-
stantly fixed upon the ground, his limbs motionless, his

(276)

 
  

Doctors and Patients

tongue dry and paralyzed, and his pulse slow.” This sufferer
was placed upon the rotatory machine, which was set at an
increasingly rapid movement. The effect surpassed expecta-
tion; the sufferer became excessively disturbed: melan-
cholic rigidity gave way to manic agitation. But this first
effect passed, and the invalid relapsed into his initial state.
The rhythm was then changed; the machine was made to
turn very rapidly, but it was stopped at regular intervals,
and in a very abrupt manner. The melancholia was driven
out, without the rotation having had time to release the
manic agitation, This “centrifugation” of melancholia is
very characteristic of the new use of the old therapeutic
themes. Movement no longer aimed at restoring the invalid
to the truth of the exterior world, but only at producing a
series of internal effects, purely mechanical and purely
psychological. It was no longer the presence of the truth
that determined the cure, but a functional norm. In this
reinterpretation of the old method, the organism was no
longer related to anything but itself and its own nature,
while in the initial version, what was to be restored was its
relation with the world, its essential link with being and
with truth: if we add that the rotatory machine was soon
used as a threat and a punishment, we see the impoverish-
ment of the meanings which had richly sustained the thera-
peutic methods throughout the entire classical period. Med-
icine was now content to regulate and to punish, with
means which had once served to exorcise sin, to dissipate
error in the restoration of madness to the world’s obvious
truth.

In 1771, Bienville wrote apropos of Nymtphomania that
there were times when it could be cured “merely by treat-
ing the imagination; but there were none or almost none
when physical remedies alone could effect a radical cure.”
And a litde later, Beauchesne: “One would undertake in

(#77)

 
 Mavwness & CIVILIZATION

vain to cure a man suffering from madness, if one tried to
succeed by physical means alone. . . . Material remedies
can never enjoy a complete success without that succor
which a strong and healthy mind affords a weak and sick
one.”

Such texts do not discover the necessity of a psycholog-
ical treatment; rather they mark the end of an era: the era
‘when the difference between physical medicaments and
moral treatments was not yet accepted as obvious by med-
ical thought. The unity of the symbols begins to break
down, and the techniques lose their total significance. They
are no longer credited with more than a local efficacity—on
the body or on the soul. The cure again changes direction;
it is no longer determined by the meaningful unity of the
disease, organized around its major qualities; but, segment
by segment, must address itself to the various elements that
compose the disease; the cure will consist of a series of
partial destructions, in which psychological attack and
physical intervention are juxtaposed, complement each
other, but never interpenetrate,

In fact, what to us seems already the outline of a psy-
chological cure was no such thing to the classical physicians
who applied it. Since the Renaissance, music had regained
all those therapeutic virtues antiquity had attributed to it.
Its effects were especially remarkable upon madness. Jo-
hann Schenck cured a man “fallen into a profound melan-
cholia” by having him attend “concerts of musical instru-
ments that particularly pleased him”; Wilhelm Albrecht
also cured a delirious patient, after having tried all other
remedies in vain, by prescribing’ the performance, during
one of his attacks, of “a little song which awakened the
sufferer, pleased him, excited him to laugh, and dispelled
the paroxysm forever.” Even cases of frenzy were cited as
having been cured by music. Now, such observations were
never meant to suggest psychological interpretations. If

(178)

music cured, it was by acting upon the entire human being,
by penetrating the body as directly, as éfficaciously as it did
the soul: did not Diemerbroek know of people stricken
with the plague who had been cured by music? Doubtless
most people no longer believed, as Giambattista della Porta
still did, that music, in the material reality of its sounds,
afforded the body the secret virtues hidden in the very
substance of the instruments; no longer believed, as he did,
that lymphatics were cured by “a lively air played on a
holly flute,” or that melancholics were soothed by “a soft
air played on a hellebore flute,” or that it was necessary to
use “‘a flute made of larkspur or iris stems to cure impotent
and frigid men.” But if music no longer transmitted the
virtues sealed in substances, it was efficacious upon the
body because of the qualities it imposed upon it. Ic even
constituted the most rigorous of all the mechanisms of qual-
ity, since at its origin it was nothing but movement,
whereas once it had reached the ear it immediately became
qualitative effect. Music’s therapeutic value occurred be-
cause this transformation was undone in the body, quality
there re-decomposed into movements, the pleasure of sen-
sation became what it had always been: regular vibrations
and equilibrium of tensions. Man, as unity of soul and
body, followed the cycle of harmony in a reverse direction,
redescending from the harmonious to the harmonic. In him,
music was decomposed, but health restored. But there was
another avenue, still more direct and more efficacious: by
taking it, man no longer played the negative role of anti-
instrument; he reacted as if he himself were the instrument:
“If one were to consider the human body as merely an
assemblage of more or less taut fibers, ignoring their sensi-
bility, their life, their movement, one would easily conceive
that music must produce the same effect on the fibers as it
does on the strings of similar instruments;”" an effect of
resonance which has no need to follow the long and com-

(779)

 
 Mavness & CIVILIZATION

plex paths of auditory sensation. The nervous system’ vi-
brates with the music that fills the air; the fibers are like so
many “deaf dancers” whose movement keeps time to a
music they do not hear. And this time, it is within the body
itself, from the nervous fiber to the soul, that the music is
recomposed, the harmonic structure of consonance restor-
ing the harmonious functioning of the passions.

The very use of passion in the therapeutics of madness
must not be understood as a form of psychological medica-
tion. To employ passion against dementia is merely to at-
tack the unity of soul and body at its most rigorous point,
to utilize an event in the double system of its effects, and in
the immediate correspondence of their meaning. To cure
madness by passion implies that one accepts the reciprocal
symbolism of soul and body. Fear, in the eighteenth cen-
tury, was regarded as one of the passions most advisable to
arouse in madmen. It was considered the natural comple-
ment of the constraints imposed upon maniacs and lunatics;
a sort of discipline was even imagined which would imme-
diately accompany and compensate every attack of anger
in 2 maniac by a reaction of fear: “It is by force that the
furies of a maniac are overcome; it is by opposing fear to
anger that anger may be mastered. If the terror of punish-
ment and public shame are associated in the mind during
attacks of anger, one will not appear without the other; the
poison and the antidote are inseparable.”*? But fear is
efficacious not only at the level of the effects of the disease;
it is the disease itself that fear attacks and suppresses. It has,
in fact, the property of petrifying the operations of the
Nervous system, somehow congealing its too mobile fibers,
controlling all their disordered movements; “fear being a
passion that diminishes the excitation of the brain, it can
consequently calm its excesses, and especially the irascible
excitation of maniacs,”*

(780)

 
 Doctors and Patients

If the fear-anger antithesis is efficacious against manic
irritation, it can be used inversely against the unmotivated
fears of melancholics, hypochondriacs, and all those who
have a lymphatic temperament. Tissot, reviving the tradi-
tional idea that anger is a discharge of bile, considers that it
is useful for dissolving the phlegms amassed in the stomach
and in the blood. By subjecting the nervous fibers to a
stronger tension, anger gives them more vigor, thus restor-
ing their lost elasticity and permitting fear to disappear.
The cure by passion is based on a constant metaphor of
qualities and movements; it always implies thar they are
immediately transferable in their own modality from the
body to the soul, and vice versa. It must be used, says
Scheidenmantel in the treatise he devotes to this form of
cure, “when the cure necessitates in the body changes
identical to those which this passion produces.” And it is
in this sense that it can be the universal substitute for all
other physical therapeutics; it is only another way to pro~
duce the same sequence of effects. Between a cure by the
passions and a cure by the prescriptions of the pharmaco-
poeia, there is no difference in nature; but only a diversity
in the mode of access to those mechanisms which are com~-
mon to the body and to the soul. “The passions must be
utilized, if the sufferer cannot be led by reason to do what
is necessary for the restoration of his health.”

It is thus not possible to use as a valid or at least meaning-
ful distinction for the classical period the difference—im-
mediately apparent to us—between physical medications
and psychological or moral medications. The difference
only begins to exist in all its profundity the day when fear
is no Jonger used as a method for arresting movement, but
as a punishment; when joy does not signify organic expan-
sion, but reward; when anger is nothing more than a re-
sponse to concerted humiliation; in short, when the nine-

C282)

 
 Mavoness & CIVILIZATION

teenth century, by inventing its famous “moral methods,”
has brought madness and its cure into the domain of guilt,
The distinction between the physical and the moral be-
comes a practical concept in the medicine of the mind
only when the problematics of madness shifts to an inter-
rogation of the subject responsible. The purely moral
space, which is then defined, gives the exact measurements
of that psychological inwardness where modern man seeks
both his depth and his truth. Physical therapeutics tends to
become, in the first half of the nineteenth century, a cure
devised by an innocent determinism, and moral treatment a
cure wrought by a culpable freedom. Psychology, as a
means of curing, is henceforth organized around punish-
ment. Before seeking to relieve, ic inflicts suffering within
the rigor of a moral necessity. “Do not employ consola-
tions, they are useless; have no recourse to reasoning, it
does not persuade; do not be sad with melancholics, your
sadness sustains theirs; do not assume an air of gaiety with
them, they are only hurt by it. What is required is great
sang-froid, and when necessary, severity. Let your reason
be their rule of conduct. A single string still vibrates in
them, that of pain; have courage enough to pluck it.”"*
The heterogeneity of the physical and the moral in med-
ical thought is not a result of Descartes’s definition of sub-
stances; 2 century and a half of post-Cartesian medicine did
not succeed in assimilating that separation on the level of
problems and methods, nor in understanding the distinction
of substances as an opposition of organic to psychological.
Cartesian or anti-Cartesian, classical medicine never intro-
duced Descartes’s metaphysical dualism into anthropology.
And when the separation did occur, it was not by a re-
newed loyalty to the Meditations, but by a new privilege
accorded to transgression. Only the use of punishment dis-
tinguished, in treating the mad, the medications of the
body from those of the soul. A purely psychological medi-

(282)

cine was made possible only when madness was alienated in
guilt.

Of this, however, a whole aspect of medical practice dur-
ing the classical period might stand as a long denial. The
psychological element, in its purity, seems to have its place
among the techniques. How else explain the importance
attached to exhortation, to persuasion, to reasoning, to that
whole dialogue in which the classical physician engages
with his patient, independently of the cure by bodily rem-
edies? How explain that Sauvages can write, in agreement
with all his contemporaries: “One must be a philosopher to
be able to cure the diseases of the soul. For as the origin of
these diseases is nothing more than a violent desire for a
thing which the sufferer envisages as a good, it is part of the
physician’s duty to prove to him by solid reasons that what
he desires so ardently is an apparent good but a real evil, in
order to make him renounce his error.”

In fact this approach to madness is neither more nor less
psychological than any of those we have already discussed.
Language, the formulations of truth or morality, are in
direct contact with the body; and it is Bienville again, in his
treatise on N-ymphomania, who shows how the adoption or
the rejection of an ethical principle can directly modify the
course of organic processes. However, there is a difference
in nature between those techniques which consist in modi-
fying the qualities common to body and soul, and those
which consist in treating madness by discourse. In the first
case, the technique is one of metaphors, at the level of a
disease that is a deterioration of nature; in the second, the
technique is one of language, at the level of a madness per-
ceived as reason’s debate with itself. The technique, in this
last form, functions in a domain where madness is “treated”
-~in all the senses of the word—in terms of truth and error.
In short, there always existed, throughout the classical

(183)

 

 
  

Manness & CIVILIZATION

period, a juxtaposition of two technical universes in the
therapeutics of madness. One, which is based on an implicir
mechanics of qualities, and which addresses madness as es~
sentially passion—that is, a certain compound (movement-
quality) belonging to both body and soul; the other, which
is based on the discursive movement of reason reasoning
with itself, and which addresses madness as error, as double
inanity of language and image, as delirium. The structural
cycle of passion and of delirium which constitutes the clas-
sical experience of madness reappears here in the world of
techniques—but in a syncopated form. Its unity is ex-
pressed only distantly. What is immediately visible, in cap-
ital letters, is the duality, almost the opposition, in the med-
icine of madness, of the methods of suppressing the disease,
and of the forms of treating unreason. These latter can be
reduced to three essential configurations.

1, Awakening. Since delirium is the dream of waking
persons, those who are delirious must be torn from this
quasi-sleep, recalled from their waking dream and its im-
ages to an authentic awakening, where the dream disap-
pears before the images of perception. Descartes sought this
absolute awakening, which dismisses one by one all the
forms of illusion, at the beginning of his Meditations, and
found it, paradoxically, in the very awareness of the dream,
in the consciousness of deluded consciousness. But in mad-
men, it is medicine which must effect the awakening, trans-
forming the solitude of Cartesian courage into an authori-
tarian intervention, by the man awake and certain of his
wakefulness, into the illusion of the man who sleeps wak-
ing: a short cut that dogmatically reduces Descartes’s long
road. What Descartes discovers at the end of his resolution
and in the doubling of a consciousness that never separates
from itself and does not split, medicine imposes from out-
side, and in the dissociation of doctor and patient. The
physician, in relation to the madman, reproduces the mo-

houses in the province of Dauphiné alone? On February
20, 1672, Louis XIV assigned to the Orders of Saint-Lazare
and Mont-Carmel the effects of all the military and hospital
orders; they were entrusted with the administration of the
lazar houses of the kingdom. Some twenty years later, the
edict of 1672 was revoked, and by a series of staggered
measures from March 1693 to July 1695 the goods of the
lazar houses were thenceforth assigned to other hospitals
and welfare establishments. The few lepers scattered in the
1,200 still-existing houses were collected at Saint-Mesmin
near Orléans. These decrees were first applied in Paris,
where the Parlement transferred the revenue in question to
the establishments of the Hépital Général; this example was
imitated by the provincial authorities; Toulouse transferred
the effects of its lazar houses to the Hépital des Incurables
(1696); those of Beaulieu in Normandy went to the Hétel-
Dicu in Caen; those of Voley were assigned to the Hopital
de Sainte-Foy. Only Saint-Mesmin and the wards of Ga-
nets, near Bordeaux, remained as a reminder.

England and Scotland alone had opened 220 lazar houses
for a million and a half inhabitants in the twelfth century.
But as early as the fourteenth century they began to empty
out; by the time Edward III ordered an inquiry into the
hospital of Ripon—in 1342—there were no more lepers; he
assigned the institution’s effects to the poor. At the end of
the twelfth century, Archbishop Puisel had founded a
hospital in which by 1434 only two beds were reserved for
lepers, should any be found. In 1348, the great leprosarium
of Saint Albans contained only three patients; the hospital
of Romenal in Kent was abandoned twenty-four years
later, for lack of lepers. At Chatham, the lazar house of
Saint Bartholomew, established in 1078, had been one of
the most important in England; under Elizabeth, it cared
for only two patients; it was finally closed in 1627.

The same regression of leprosy occurred in Germany,
perhaps a little more slowly; and the same conversion of

(5)

 
 Doctors and Patients

ment of the Cogito in relation to the time of the dream, of
illusion, and of madness. A completely exterior Cogito,
alien to cogitation itself, and which can be imposed upon it
only in the form of an invasion.

This structure of invasion by wakefulness is one of the
most constant forms among the therapeutics of madness. It
often assumes the simplest aspects, simultaneously those
most highly charged with images and those most credited
with immediate powers. It is asserted that 2 gun discharged
near her cured a young girl of convulsions contracted as
the result of severe grief. Without going so far as this icon-
ographic representation of the methods of awakening, sud-
den and strong emoti: ns achieve the same result. It is in this
spirit that Boerhaave performed his famous cure of con-
vulsives at Haarlem. In the city hospiral, an epidemic of
convulsions had broken out. Antispasmodics, administered
in strong doses, did no good. Boerhaave ordered “that
stoves filled with burning coals be brought, and that iron
hooks of a certain form be heated in them; thereupon, he
said m a loud voice that since all the means hitherto em-
ployed in attempting to cure the convulsions had been use-
less, he knew of only one other remedy, which was to bum
to the bone, with red-hot irons, a certain spot on the arm of
any person, male or female, who suffered an attack of a
convulsive illness.”**

Slower, but also more certain of the truth it confronts, is
the awakening that proceeds from wisdom itself and from
its insistent, imperative progress through the landscapes of
madness, From this wisdom, in its various forms, Willis
sought the cure of the various madnesses. For imbeciles, a
pedagogical wisdom; an “attentive and devoted master
must educate them completely”; they must be taught, little
by little and very slowly, what children are taught in
school. For melancholics, a wisdom that takes as its model
the most rigorous and most evident forms of trath: what is

(18s)

 
  

Mavness & CIVILIZATION

imaginary in their delirium will disappear in the light of an
incontestable truth; this is why “mathematical and chem-
ical” studies are strongly recommended. For the others, the
wisdom of a well-ordered life will reduce their delirium;
there is no need to impose upon them any other truth than
that of their everyday life; remaining in their homes, “they
must continue to manage their affairs, direct their families,
order and cultivate their estates, their gardens, their or-
chards, their fields.” It is, on the contrary, the exactitude of
a social order, imposed from without and, if necessary, by
force, that can gradually restore the minds of maniacs to
the light of truth: “For this, the insane person, placed in a
special house, will be treated, either by the doctor or by
trained assistants, in such a way that he may be always
maintained in his duty, in his appearance and habits, by
warnings, by remonstrances, and by punishments immedi-
ately inflicted.”**

Little by little during the classical period, this authori-
tarian awakening of madness would lose its original mean-
ing and limit itself to being no more than recollection of
moral Jaw, return to the good, fidelity to the law. What
Willis still intended as a reintroduction to troth would no
longer be entirely understood by Sauvages, who speaks of
lucidity in the recognition of the good: “Thus, one can
recall to reason those whom false principles of moral phi-
losophy have caused to lose their own, as long as they are
willing to examine with us what is truly good, and what
things are to be preferred to others.” Already it is no
longer as awakener that the physician is to function, but as
moralist. Against madness, Tissot considers that “a pure
conscience, without reproach, is an excellent preservative.”
And soon comes Pinel, for whom the awakening to truth
no longer has a meaning in the cure, but only obedience
and blind submission: “A fundamental principle for the
cure of mania in a great number of cases is to resort first of

(286)
  

Doctors and Patients

all to an energetic repression, and to proceed subsequently
to methods of benevolence.”

2. Theatrical Representation. In appearance at least,
this is a technique rigorously opposed to that of awakening.
There, delirium, in all its immediate vivacity, ‘was con-
fronted by the patient work of reason. Either in the form
of a slow pedagogy, or the form of an authoritarian inva-
sion, reason was imposed, as if by the weight of its own
being. The non-being of madness, the inanity of error, was
forced to yield, finally, to this pressure of the truch. Here,
the therapeutic operation functions entirely in the space of
the imagination; we are dealing with a complicity of the
unreal with itself; the i imagination must play its own game,
voluntarily propose new images, espouse delirium for de-
lirium’s sake, and without opposition or confrontation,
without even a visible dialectic, must, paradoxically, cure,
Health must lay siege to madness and conquer it in the very
nothingness in which the disease is imprisoned, When the
imagination “tis sick, it can be cured only by the effect of a
healthy and active imagination. . . . Ic is all one whether
the invalid’s imagination is cured by fear, by a strong and
painful impression upon the senses, or by an illusion.”
Illusion can cure the illusory—while reason alone can free
from the unreasonable. What then is this dark power of the
imaginary?

Insofar as it is of the essence of the image to be taken for
reality, it is reciprocally characteristic of realiry that it can
mime the image, pretend to the same substance, the same
significance. Without a break, without a jolt, perception
can continue the dream, fill in its gaps, confirm what is
precarious about it, and lead it to its fulfillment. If illusion
can appear as true as perception, perception in its curn can
become the visible, unchallengeable truth of illusion. Such
is the first step of the cure by “theatrical representation”:
to integrate the unreality of the image into perceived truth,

(787)

  
  

Manvness & CIVILIZATION

without the Jatter seeming to contradict or even contest the
former. Thus Zacatus Lusitanus describes the cure of a
melancholic who believed himself damned while still on
earth because of the enormity of the sins he had committed.
In the impossibility of convincing him by reasonable argu-
ments that he could be saved, his physicians accepted his
delirium and caused an “angel” dressed in white, with a
sword in its hand, to appear co him, and after a severe
exhortation this delusive vision announced that his sins had
been remitted.

From this very example, we see the next step: representa-
tion within the #mage is not enough, it is also necessary to
continue the delirious discourse. For in the patient's insane
words there is a voice that speaks; it obeys its own gram-
mar, it articulates a meaning. Grammar and meaning must
be maintained in such a way that the representation of the
hallucination in reality does not seem like the transition
from one register to another, like a translation into a new
language, with an altered meaning. The same language
must continue to make itself understood, merely bringing a
new deductive element to the rigor of its discourse. Yet this
element is not indifferent; the problem is not to pursue the
delirium, but by continuing it to bring it to an end. Ic must
be led to a state of paroxysm and crisis in which, without
any addition of a foreign element, it is confronted by itself
and forced to argue against the demands of its own truth.
The real and perceptual discourse that prolongs the deliri-
ous language of the images must therefore, without
escaping the latter’s laws, without departing from its sover-
eignty, exercise a positive function in relation to it; it tight-
ens that language around its essential element; if it
Tepresents it at the risk of confirming it, it is in order to
dramatize it. The case is cited of a sufferer who thought
that he was dead, and was really dying from not eating; “a
group of people who had made themselves pale and were

(288)
 Doctors and Patients

dressed like the dead, entered his room, set up a table,
brought food, and began to eat and drink before the bed.
The starving ‘dead man’ looked at them; they were aston-
ished that he stayed in bed; they persuaded him that dead
people eat at least as much as living ones. He readily ac-
commodated himself to this idea.””* It is within a contin-
uous discourse that the elements of delirium, coming into
contradiction, bring on the crisis. A crisis which is, in a
very ambiguous manner, both medical and theatrical, a
whole tradition of Western medicine dating from Hip-
pocrates here intersects, suddenly and for only a few years,
with one of the major forms of theatrical experience.
Before us appears the great theme of a crisis that confronts
the madman with his own meaning, reason with unreason,
man’s lucid ruse with the blindness of the lunatic—a crisis
which marks the point at which illusion, turned back upon
itself, will open to the dazzlement of truth.

This opening is imminent in the crisis; in fact it is this
opening, with its immediate proximity, that constitutes the
essential element of the crisis. But the opening does not
result from the crisis itself. In order for the crisis to be
medical and not simply dramatic, in order for it to be not
an annihilation of the man, but simply a suppression of the
disease; in short, in order for the dramatic representation of
the delirium to have an effect of comic purification, a ruse
must be introduced at 2 given moment. A ruse, or at least
an element which surreptitiously alters the autonomous
operation of the delirium, and which, ceaselessly confirm-
ing it, does not bind it to its own truth without at the same
time linking it to the necessity for its own suppression. The
simplest example of this method is the ruse employed with
delirious patients who imagine they perceive within their
bodies an object or an extraordinary animal: “When an
invalid believes that he has a living animal shut up within
his body, one must pretend to have withdrawn it; if ic is in

(789)

 

 
 Manvness & CIVILIZATION

the stomach, one may, by means of a powerful purge, pro-
duce this effect, throwing such an animal into the basin
without the patient’s noticing.”"* The theatrical device
represents the object of the delirium bute cannot do so
without externalizing it, and if it gives the invalid a percep-
tual confirmation of his illusion, it does so only while rid-
ding him of it by force. The artificial reconstitution of
delirium constitutes the real distance in which the sufferer
recovers his liberty.

But sometimes, there is even no need of this “distancing.”
It is within the quasi-perception of the delirium that there
is established, by means of a ruse, a perceptual element,
silent at first, but whose gradual affirmacion will come to
contest the entire system. It is in himself and in the percep-
tion which confirms his delirium that the sufferer perceives
the liberating reality. Trallion reports how a physician dis-
sipated the delirium of a melancholic who imagined he had
no head, but only a kind of void in its place; the physician,
entering into the delirium, agreed at the sufferer’s request to
fill up this space, and placed upon his head a great bail of
lead. Soon the discomfort that resulted from the painful
weight convinced the invalid that he had a head. Uld-
mately the ruse and its function of comic reduction can be
assured, with the complicity of the physician but without
any other direct intervention on his part, by the spontane-
ous reaction of the sufferer’s organism. In the case cited
above of the melancholic who was really dying because he
would not eat, believing himself already dead, the theatrical
representation of a dead men’s banquet incited him to eat;
this nourishment restored him, “the consumption of food
made him quieter,” and the organic disorder thus disappear-
ing, the delirium which was indissociably cause and effect
disappeared forthwith. Thus the real death that would have
resulted from the imaginary death was avoided by reality,
by the mere representation of unreal death. The exchange

(790)

 
 Doctors and Patients

of non-being with itself is carried out in this ingenious
play: the non-being of delirium is rurned against the being
of the illness, and suppresses it by the simple fact that it is
driven out of the delirium by dramatic representation. The
fulfillment of delirium’s non-being in being is able to sup-
press it as non-being itself; and this by the pure mechanism
of its internal contradiction—a mechanism that is both a
play on words and a play of illusion, games of language and
of the image; the delirium, in effect, is suppressed as non-
being since it becomes a perceived form of being; but since
the being of delirium is entirely in its non-being, it is sup-
pressed as delirium, And its confirmation in theatrical fan-
tasy restores it to a truth which, by holding it captive in
reality, drives it out of reality itself, and makes it disappear
in the non-delirious discourse of reason. ,
3- The Return to the Immediate. Since madness is illu-
sion, the cure of madness, if it is true that such a cure can
be effected by theater, can also and still more directly be
effected by the suppression of theater. To entrust madness
and its empty world directly to the plenitude of a nature
which does not deceive because its immediacy does not ac-
knowledge non-being, is to deliver madness both to its own
truth (since madness, as a disease, is after all only a natural
being), and to its closest contradiction (since delirium, as
appearance without content, is the very contrary of the
often secret and invisible wealth of nature). This contra-
diction thus appears as the reason of unreason, in a double
sense: it withholds unreason’s causes, and at the same time
conceals the principle of its suppression. It must be noted,
however, that these themes are not contemporary with the
classical period for its entire duration. Although they are
organized around the same experience of unreason, they
follow after the themes of theatrical representation; and
their appearance marks the moment when the debate on
being and illusion begins to yield to a problematics of na-

(797)

 
 Mavoness & CIVILIZATION

tare. Games of theatrical illusion lose their meaning, and
the artificial techniques of iconographic representation are
replaced by the simple and confident act of a natural re-
duction, And this in an ambiguous direction, since it is as
ouch a question of reduction by nature as of a reduction to
nature.

The return to the immediate is the therapeutics par ex-
cellence, because it is the rigorous refusal of therapeutics: it
cures insofar as it is a disregard of all cures. It is in man’s
passivity with regard to himself, in the silence he imposes
on his art and his artifices, that nature engages in an activity
which is exactly reciprocal to renunciation. For, to con-
sider it more closely, this passivity of man is real activity;
when man entrusts himself to medicine, he escapes the law
of labor that nature itself imposes on him; he sinks into the
world of artifice, and of anri-nature, of which his madness
is only one of the manifestations; it is by ignoring this dis-
ease and resuming his place in the activity of natural beings
that man in an apparent passivity (which is in fact only an
industrious fidelity) succeeds in being cured. Thus Berna-
din de Saint-Pierre explains how he cured himself of 2
“strange disease,” in which, “like Oedipus, he saw two
suns.” Medicine had offered him its succor, and had in-
formed him that “the seat of his disease was in the nerves.”
In vain he applied the most highly prized medicaments; he
soon noticed that the physicians themselves were killed by
their own remedies: “Te was to Jean-Jacques Rousseau that
I owed my return to health. I had read, in his immortal
writings, among other natural truths, that man is made to
work, not to meditate, Until that time I had exercised my
soul and rested my body; I changed my ways; I exercised
my body and rested my soul. I gave up most books; I
turned my eyes to the works of nature, which addressed
all my senses in a language that neither time nor nations can
corrupt. My history and my newspapers were the plants of

(192)

 
 Doctors and Patients

the field and forest; it was not my thoughts that struggled
to them, as in the system of men, but their thoughts that
came to me in a thousand agreeable shapes.””

Despite the formulations of it which certain disciples of
Rousseau managed to propose, this return to the immediate
was neither absolute nor simple. For madness, even if it is
provoked or sustained by what is most artificial in society,
appears, in its violent forms, as the savage expression of the
most primitive human desires. Madness in the classical pe-
riod, as we have seen, is rooted in the threats of bestialiry—
a bestiality completely dominated by predatory and mur-
derous instincts. To entrust madness to nature would be,
by an uncontrolled reversal, to abandon it to that fury of
anti-nature. The cure of madness thus supposes a return to
what is immediate, not in relation to desire, but in relation
to the imagination—a return that dismisses from man’s life
and pleasures everything that is artificial, unreal, imaginary.
The therapeutics, by the reflective plunge into the immedi-
ate, secretly supposes the mediation of a wisdom which
distinguishes, in nature, between what derives from vio~
lence and what derives from truth. This is the whole differ-
ence between the Savage and the Laborer. “Savages . . .
fead the life of a carnivorous animal rather than that of a
reasonable being”; the life of the Laborer, on the other
hand, “is in fact happier than that of the man of the
world.” On the savage’s side, immediate desire, without
discipline, without constraint, without real morality; on the
laborer’s side, pleasure without mediation, in other words,
without vain stimulus, without provocation or imaginary
achievement. What, in nature and its immediate virmes,
cures madness is pleasure—but a pleasure that on one hand
makes desire vain without even having to repress it, since it
offers a plenitude of satisfaction in advance, and on the
other makes imagination absurd, since it spontaneously
contributes the happy presence of reality. “Pleasures enter

into the eternal order of things; they exist invariably; cer-
tain conditions are necessary to form them .. . ; these
conditions are not arbitrary; nature has formed them; imag-
ination cannot create, and the man most devoted to plea-
sures can increase them only by renouncing all those which
do not bear this stamp of nature.”** The immediate world
of the laborer is thus a world suffused with wisdom and
measure, which cures madness insofar as it renders desire
useless, along with the movements of passion desire gives
rise to, and also insofar as it reduces along with the imagi-
nary all the possibilities of delirium, What Tissot under-
stands by “pleasure” is this immediate curative agent, liber-
ated from both passion and language: that is, from the two
great forms of human experience that give birth to un-
reason.

And perhaps nature, as the concrete form of the immedi-
ate, has an even more fundamental power in the suppression
of madness, For it has the power of freeing man from his
freedom. In narure—that nature, at least, which is measured
by the double exclusion of the violence of desire and the
unreality of hallucination—man is doubtless liberated from
social constraints (those which force him “to calculate and
draw up the balance sheet of his imaginary pleasures which
bear that name but are none”) and from the uncontrollable
movement of the passions. But by that very fact, he is
gently and as it were internally bound by a system of nata-
ral obligations. The pressures of the healthiest needs, the
rhythm of the days and the seasons, the calm necessity to
feed and shelter oneself, constrain the disorder of madmen
to a regular observance. The excessively remote inventions
of the imagination are dismissed, along with the excessively
urgent disguises of desire. In the gentleness of a pleasure
that does not constrain, man is linked to the wisdom of
nature, and this fidelity in the form of freedom dissipates
the unreason which juxtaposes in its paradox the extreme

the lazar houses, hastened by the Reformation, which left
municipal administrations in charge of welfare and hospital
establishments; this was the case in Leipzig, in Munich, in
Hamburg. In 1542, the effects of the lazar houses of Schles-
wig-Holstein were transferred to the hospitals. In Stuttgart
a magistrate’s report of 1589 indicates that for fifty years
already there had been no lepers in the house provided for
them. At Lipplingen, the lazar house was soon peopled
with incurables and madmen.

A strange disappearance, which was doubtless not the
long-sought effect of obscure medical practices, but the
spontaneous result of segregation and also the consequence,
after the Crusades, of the break with the Eastern sources of
infection. Leprosy withdrew, leaving derelict these low
places and these rites which were intended, not to suppress
it, but to keep it at a sacred distance, to fix it in an inverse
exaltation. What doubtless remained longer ‘than leprosy,
and would persist when the lazar houses had been empty
for years, were the values and images attached to the figure
of the leper as well as the meaning of his exclusion, the
social importance of that insistent and fearful figure which
was not driven off without first being inscribed within a
sacred circle.

If the leper was removed from the world, and from the
community of the Church visible, his existence was yet a
constant manifestation of God, since it was a sign both of
His anger and of His grace: “My friend,” says the ritual of
the Church of Vienne, “it pleaseth Our Lord that thou
shouldst be infected with this malady, and thou hast great
grace at the hands of Our Lord that he desireth to punish
thee for thy iniquities in this world.” And at the very
moment when the priest and his assistants drag him out of
the church with backward step, the leper is assured that he
still bears witness for God: “And howsoever thou mayest
be apart from the Church and the company of the Sound,
yet art thou not apart from the grace of God.” Brueghel’s

determinism of passion and the extreme fantasy of the
image. Thus one begins to dream, in these mingled land-
scapes of ethics and medicine, of a liberation from madness:
a liberation that must not be understood in its origin as the
discovery, by philanthropy, of the humanity of madmen,
but as a desire to open madness to the gentle constraints of
nature.

The old village of Gheel which, from the end of the
Middle Ages, still bore witness to the now forgotten rela-
tion between the confinement of madmen and the exclusion
of lepers, also received in the last years of the eighteenth
century a sudden reinterpretation. What had once marked,
here, the entire violent, pathetic separation of the world of
madmen from the world of men, now conveyed the idyllic
values of a rediscovered unity of unreason and nature. This
village had once signified that madmen were confined, and
that therefore the man of reason was protected from them;
now it manifested that the madman was liberated, and that,
" in this liberty which put him on a level with the laws of
nature, he was reconciled with the man of reason, At
Gheel, according to Jouy’s description of it, “four-fifths of
the inhabitants are mad, but mad in the full sense of the
word, and they enjoy without restraint the same freedom
as the other citizens... . Healthful food, pure air, all the de-
vices of liberty: such is the regimen prescribed for them,
and to which the greatest number, by the end of a year,
owe their cure.” Without anything in the instirutions hav-
ing as yet really changed, the meaning of exclusion and of
confinement begins to alter: it slowly assumes positive val-
ues, and the neutral, empty, nocturnal space in which un-
reason was formerly restored to its nothingness begins to be
peopled by a nature to which madness, liberated, is obliged
to submit. Confinement, as the separation of reason from
unreason, is not suppressed; but at the very heart of its
intention, the space it occupies reveals natural powers,

(19s)

 
  

Manvness & CIVILIZATION

more constraining for madness, more likely to subjugate it
in its essence, than the whole of the old limiting and re-
pressive system. Madness must be liberated from that sys-
tem so that, in the space of confinement, now endowed
with a positive efficacity, it will be free to slough off its
savage freedom, and to welcome the demands of nature
that are for it both cruth and law. Insofar as it is law, nature
constrains the violence of desire; insofar as it is truth, it
reduces anti-nature, and all the hallucinations of the imag-

inary.

Here is how Pinel describes that nature, speaking of the
hospital of Saragossa: there has been established here “a
sort of counterpoise to the mind’s extravagances by the
attraction and the charm inspired by the cultivation of
the fields, by the natural instinct that leads man to sow the
earth and thus to satisfy his needs by the fruit of his labors.
From morning on, you can see them . . . leaving gaily for
the various parts of a vast enclosure that belongs to the
hospital, sharing with a sort of emulation the tasks appro-
priate to the seasons, cultivating wheat, vegetables, con~
cerned in turn with the harvest, with trellises, with the
vintage, with olive picking, and finding in the evening, in
their solitary asylum, calm and quiet sleep. The most con-
stant experience has indicated, in this hospital, that this is
the surest and most efficacious way to restore man to rea-
son.”* Beneath the conventional images, the rigor of a
meaning is easily perceived. The return to the immediate is
effective against unreason only insofar as the immediate is
controlled—and divided against itself; an immediate in
which violence is isolated from truth, savagery separated
from liberty, in which nature can no longer recognize itself
in the fantastic figures of anti-nature. In short, an immedi-
ate in which nature is mediatized by morality. In a space so
arranged, madness will never again be able to speak the
language of unreason, with ali that in it transcends the

(196)
 Doctors and Patients

natural phenomena of disease. It will be entirely enclosed in
a pathology. A transformation which later periods have
received as a positive acquisition, the accession, if not of a
truth, at least of what would make the recognition of truth
possible; but which in the eyes of history must appear as
what it was: that is, the reduction of the classical experi-
ence of unreason to a strictly moral perception of madness,
which would secretly serve as a nucleus for all the concepts
that the nineteenth century would subsequently vindicate
as scientific, positive, and experimental.

This metamorphosis, which occurred in the second half
of the eighteenth century, was initiated in the techniques of
cure. But it very quickly appeared more generally, winning
over the minds of reformers, guiding the great reorganiza-
tion of the experience of madness in the last years of the
century. Very soon Pinel could write: “How necessary it
is, in order to forestall hypochondria, melancholia, or ma-
hia, to follow the immutable laws of morality!”

In the classical period, it is futile to try to distinguish
physical therapeutics from psychological medications, for
the simple reason that psychology did not exist. When the
consumption of bitters was prescribed, for example, it was
not a question of physical treatment, since it was the soul as
well as the body that was to be scoured; when the simple
life of a laborer was prescribed for a melancholic, when the
comedy of his delirium was acted out before him, this was
not a psychological intervention, since the movement of
the spirits in the nerves, the density of the humors were
principally involved. But in the first case, we are dealing
with an art of the transformation of qualities, a technique
in which the essence of madness is taken as nature, and as
disease; in the second, we are dealing with an art of dis-
course, and of the restitution of truth, in which madness is
significant as unreason.

(797)

 
 Manvness & CIVILIZATION

When, in the years that followed, this great experience
of unreason, whose unity is characteristic of the classical
period, was dissociated, when madness, entirely confined
within a moral intuition, was nothing more than disease,
then the distinction we have just established assumed an-
other meaning; what had belonged to disease pertained to
the organic, and what had belonged to unreason, to the
transcendence of its discourse, was relegated to the psycho-
logical. And it is precisely here that psychology was born
—hot as the truth of madness, but as a sign that madness
was now detached from its truth which was unreason and
that it was henceforth nothing but a phenomenon adrift,
insignificant upon the undefined surface of nature. An
enigma without any truth except that which could reduce
it.

This is why we must do justice to Freud. Between
Freud’s Five Case Histories and Janet’s scrupulous investi-
gations of Psychological Healing, there is more than the
density of a discovery; there is the sovereign violence of a
return, Janet enumerated the elements of a division, drew
up his inventory, annexed here and there, perhaps con-
quered. Freud went back to madness at the level of its
language, reconstituted one of the essential elements of an
experience reduced to silence by positivism; he did not
make a major addition to the list of psychological treat-
ments for madness; he restored, in medical thought, the
possibility of a dialogue with unreason. Let us not be sur-
prised that the most “psychological” of medications has so
quickly encountered its converse and its organic confirma-
tions. It is not psychology that is involved in psychoanal-
ysis: but precisely an experience of unreason that it has
been psychology’s meaning, in the modern world, to mask.

 
  

THE GREAT FEAR

“One afternoon, I was there, looking 2 great deal, speaking
rarely, listening as little as I could, when I was accosted by
one of the most bizarre persons in this country, where God
has not let them lack. He was a mixture of loftiness, base-
ness, good sense, and unreason.”

In doubt’s confrontation with its major dangers, Des-
cartes realized that he could not be mad—though he was to
acknowledge for a long time to come that all the powers of
unreason kept vigil around his thought; but as a philoso-
pher, resolutely undertaking to doubt, he could not be
“one of these insane ones.” Rameau’s Nephew, though,
knew quite well—and among his fleeting certainties, this
was the most obstinate—that he was mad. “Before begin-
ning, he heaved a profound sigh and raised his hands to his
forehead; then he regained his calm demeanor and said to
me: you know I am ignorant, mad, impertinent, and
lazy.”*

The eighteenth century could not exactly understand
the meaning expressed in Le Neveu de Rameau. Yet some-

(199)

 
   

 
   

Maoness & CIVILIZATION

thing had happened, just when the text was written, which
promised a decisive change. A curious thing: the unreason
that had been relegated to the distance of confinement re-
appeared, fraught with new dangers and as if endowed
with a new power of interrogation. Yet what the cigh-
teenth century first noticed about it was not the secret
interrogation, but only the social effects: the torn clothing,
the arrogance in rags, the tolerated insolence whose dis-
turbing powers were silenced by an amused indulgence.
The eighteenth century might not have recognized itself in
Rameau’s Nephew, but it was entirely present in the J who
served him as interlocutor and as a type of “exhibitor,”
amused yet reticent, and with a secret anxiety: for this was
the first time since the Great Confinement that the madman
had become a social individual; ic was the first time that
anyone had entered into conversation with him, and that,
once again, he was questioned. Unreason reappeared as 2
classification, which is not much, but it nonetheless reap-
peared, and slowly recovered its place in the familiarity of
the social landscape. It was there some ten years before the
Revolution, when Mercier found it without more astonish-
ment than: “Go into another café; a man whispers to you in
a calm and confident tone: ‘You cannot imagine, Monsieur,
the Government’s ingratitude toward me, and its blindness
to its own interests! For thirty years I have neglected my
own affairs; I have shut myself up in my study, meditating,
dreaming, calculating; I have devised a project to pay all
the State’s debts; another to enrich the King and assure him
an income of 400 million; another to destroy England for-
ever, whose very name affronts me... . When, utterly
devoted to these vast operations that demand all the appli-
cation of genius, I was distracted by domestic problems,
some nagging creditors kept me in prison for three years.

. . But, Monsieur, you see how patriotism is valued—I
die unknown and a martyr for my country.’ "? At a dis-

(200)
  

 

The Great Fear

tance, such persons form a circle around Rameau’s
Nephew; they do not have his dimensions; it is only in the
search for the picturesque that they can pass for his epi-
mes.
Ona yet they are a little more than a social profile, a
caricatural silhouette. There is something inside them that
concerns and touches the unreason of the eighteenth cen-
tary. Their chatter, their anxiety, that vague delirium and
that ultimate anguish they experience commonly enough—
and in real existences which can still be traced. As with the
libertine, the debauchee, or the ruffian of the end of the
seventeenth century, it is difficult to say whether they are
mad, sick, or criminal. Mercier himself does not quite know
what status to give them: “Thus there are in Paris some
very good people, economists and anti-economists, who
have warm hearts, eager for the public good; but unfortu-
nately they have cracked heads; that is, they are short-
sighted, they do nor know what century they are in, nor
what men they are dealing with; more unbearable than
idiots, because with pennies and false lights they start from
an impossible principle and reason falsely therefrom.”
They really existed, these schemers with “cracked heads,”
adding a muffled accompaniment of unreason to the reason
of the philosophers, and around those plans for reform,
those constitutions, those projects; the rationality of the
Enlightenment found in them a sort of darkened mirror, an
inoffensive caricature, But is it not essential that in 2
movement of amused indulgence, a personage of unreason
is allowed back into daylight, ac the very moment he was
believed to be most profoundly hidden in the space of con-
fmement? As if classical reason once again admitted a
proximity, a relation, a quasi-resemblance between itself
and the images of unreason. As if, ac the moment of its
triumph, reason revived and permitted to drift on the mar-
gins of order a character whose mask it had fashioned in

 
  

Manvwess & CIVILIZATION

derision—a sort of double in which it both recognized and
revoked itself.

Yer fear and anxiety were not far off: in the reaction of
confinement, they reappeared, doubled. People were once
afraid, people were still afraid, of being confined; at the end
of the eighteenth century, Sade was still haunted by fear of
what he called “the black men” who lay in wait to put him
away. But now the estate of confinement acquired its own
powers; it became in its turn the birthplace of evil, and
could henceforth spread that evil by itself, insticuting an-
other reign of terror,

Suddenly, in a few years in the middle of the eighteenth
century, a fear arose--a fear formulated in medical terms
but animated, basically, by a moral myth. People were in
dread of a mysterious disease that spread, it was said, from
the houses of confinement and would soon threaten the
cities. They spoke of prison fevers; they evoked the wag~
ons of criminals, men in chains who passed through the
cities, leaving disease in their wake; scurvy was thought to
cause contagions; it was said that the air, tainted by disease,
would corrupt the residential quarters, And the great image
of medieval horror reappeared, giving birth, in the meta-
phors of dread, to a second panic. The house of confine-
ment was no longer only the lazar house at the city’s edge;
it was leprosy itself confronting the town: “A terrible ul-
cer upon the body politic, an ulcer that is wide, deep, and
draining, one that cannot be imagined except by looking
full upon ir. Even the air of the place, which can be smelled
four hundred yards away—everything suggests that one is
approaching a place of violence, an asylum of degradation
and infortune.”* Many of these centers of confinement
were built in the very places where the lepers had once
been kept; it was as if, across the centuries, the new tenants
had received the contagion. They revived the blazon and

(202)
 The Great Fear

the meaning that had been borne in those places: “Too
great a leper for the capital! The name of Bicétre is 2 word
no one can pronounce without an inexpressible feeling of
repugnance, of horror and contempt. . . . It has become
the receptacle for all the most monstrous and vile things to
be found in society.”*

The evil which men had attempted to exclude by con-
finement reappeared, to the horror of the public, in a fan-
tastic guise. There appeared, ramifying in every direction,
the themes of an evil, both physical and moral, that envel-
oped in this very ambiguity the mingled powers of corro-
sion and horror. There prevailed, then, a sort of undiffer-
entiated image of “rottenness” that had to do with the
corruption of morals as well as with the decomposition of
the flesh, and upon which were based both the repugnance
and the pity felt for the confined. First the evil began to
ferment in the closed spaces of confinement. It had all the
virtues attributed to acid in eighteenth-century chemistry:
its fine particles, sharp as needles, penetrated bodies and
hearts as easily as if they were passive and friable alkaline
particles. The mixture boiled immediately, releasing harm-
ful vapors and corrosive liquids: “These wards are a dread-
ful place where all crimes together ferment and spread
around them, as by fermentation, a contagious atmosphere
which those who live there breathe and which seems to
become attached to them.’ These burning vapors then
rise, spread through the air, and finally fall upon the neigh-
borhood, impregnating bodies and contaminating souls.
Thus the idea of a contagion of evil-as-rottenness is articu-
lated in images. The palpable agent of this epidemic is air,
that air which is called “tainted,” the term obscurely sug-
gesting that it is not in conformity with the purity of its
nature, and that it acts as the communicating element of the
taint. It is sufficient to remember the value, both moral and
medical, ascribed at about the same period to country air

(203)

 
   

 
   

Mavwness & CIVILIZATION

(bodily health, spiritual vigor), to realize the whole com-
plex of contrary meanings conveyed by the corrupted air
of hospitals, prisons, houses of confinement. By this atmos-
phere laden with maleficent vapors, entire cities were
threatened, whose inhabitants would be slowly impreg-
nated with rottenness and taint.

And these are not only reflections halfway between
morality and medicine. We must doubtless take into ac-
count an entire literary development, 2 whole emotional,
perhaps political exploitation of vague fears. But in certain
cities there were movements of panic as real, as easy to
date, as the great crises of horror that wracked the Middle
Ages from time to time. In 1780 an epidemic spread
through Paris: its origin was attributed to the infection of
the Hopital Général; there was even talk of burning the
buildings of Bicétre, The police lieutenant, faced with the
frenzy of the population, sent 2 commission of inquiry
which included, together with several staff doctors, the
Dean of the Faculté and the physician of the Hépital Gé-
néral. According to their findings, Bicérre was subject to a
“putrid fever” which was linked to the bad quality of the
air. As for the original source of the disease, the report
denied that it lay in the internees and the infection they
might spread; it must be attributed quite simply to the bad
weather that made the disease endemic in the capital; the
symptoms that were to be observed at the Hépital Général
were “in accordance with the nature of the season and ex-
actly the same as the illnesses observed in Paris at the same
period.” The population had to be reassured and Bicétre
cleared of its guilt: “The rumors that have begun to spread
concerning a contagious illness at Bicétre that is capable of
infecting the capital are without foundation.” Evidently
the report did not check the rumors completely, since some
time later the physician of the Hépital Général issued an-
other in which he made the same statement; he was forced

(204)
  

“Stultifera Navis”

lepers attend at a distance, but forever, that climb to Cal-
vary on which the entire people accompanies Christ. Hier-
atic witnesses of evil, they accomplish their salvation in and
by their very exclusion: in a strange reversibility that is the
opposite of good works and prayer, they are saved by the
hand that is not stretched out. The sinner who abandons
the leper at his door opens his way to heaven. “For which
have patience in thy malady; for Our Lord hateth thee not
because of it, keepeth thee not from his company; but if
thou hast patience thou wilt be saved, as was the leper who
died before the gate of the rich man and was carried
straight to paradise.” Abandonment is his salvation; his ex-
clusion offers him another form of communion.

Leprosy disappeared, the leper vanished, or almost, from
memory; these structures remained. Often, in these same
places, the formulas of exclusion would be repeated,
strangely similar two or three centuries later. Poor vaga-
bonds, criminals, and “deranged minds” would take the
part played by the leper, and we shall see what salvation
was expected from this exclusion, for them and for those
who excluded them as well. With an altogether new mean-
ing and in a very different culture, the forms would re-
main--essentially that major form of a rigorous division
which is social exclusion but spiritual reintegration.

Something new appears in the imaginary landscape of
the Renaissance; soon it will occupy a privileged place
there: the Ship of Fools, a strange “drunken boat” chat
glides along the calm rivers of the Rhineland and the Flem-
ish canals.

The Narrenschiff, of course, is a literary composition,
probably borrowed from the old Argonaut cycle, one of
the great mythic themes recently revived and rejuvenated,
acquiring an institutional aspect in the Burgundy Escates.
Fashion favored the composition of these Ships, whose

(7)

 
  

The Great Fear

to acknowledge the poor sanitary conditions of Bicétre, but
“matters have not, for all that, reached the cruel extremity
of converting the refuge of these unforcunates into another
source of inevitable evils much more lamentable than those
which require a remedy as prompt as it is efficacious.”

The circle was closed: all those forms of unreason which
had replaced leprosy in the geography of evil, and which
had been banished into the remotest social distance, now
became a visible leprosy and offered their running sores to
the promiscuity of men. Unreason was once more present;
but marked now by an imaginary stigma of disease, which
added its powers of terror.

Thus it is in the realm of the fantastic and not within the
rigor of medical thought that unreason joins illness and
draws closer to it. Long before the problem of discovering
to what degree the unreasonable is pathological was formu-
lated, there had formed, in the space of confinement and by
an alchemy peculiar to it, a mélange combining the dread
of unreason and the old specters of disease. From a great
distance, the old confusions about leprosy functioned once
again; and it is the vigor of these fantastic themes which
was the first agent of synthesis between the world of un-
reason and the medical universe. They first communicated
through the hallucinations of fear, combining the infernal
mixtures of “corruption” and “taint.” It is important, per-
haps decisive for the place madness was to occupy in mod-
ern culture, that homo medicus was not called into the
world of confinement as an arbiter, to divide what was
crime from what was madness, what was evil from what
was illness, but rather as a guardian, to protect others from
the vague danger that exuded through the walls of con-
finement. It is easy to suppose that a free and generous
sympathy awakened interest in the fate of the confined,
and that a more diligent and informed medical attention
could recognize disease where previously the authorities

(203)

 
  

MavDNESS & CIVILIZATION

had indiscriminately punished transgressions. As it hap-
pened, the atmosphere was not one of such benevolent neu-
trality. If a doctor was summoned, if he was asked to ob-
serve, it was because people were afraid—afraid of the
strange chemistry that seethed behind the walls of con-
finement, afraid of the powers forming there that threat-
ened to propagate. The doctor came, once the conversion
of images was effected, the disease having already assumed
the ambiguous aspects of fermentation, of corruption, of
tainted exhalations, of decomposed flesh. What is tradition-
ally called “progress” toward madness’s attaining a medical
status was in fact made possible only by a strange regres-
sion. In the inextricable mixture of moral and physical
contagions,® and by virtue of that symbolism of Impurity
so familiar to the eighteenth century, very early images
Tose again to the surface of human memory, And it was as a
result of this reactivation of images, more than by an im-
provement of knowledge, that unreason was eventually
confronted by medical thought. Paradoxically, in the re-
turn to that fantastic life which mingles with the con-
temporary images of illness, positivism would gain a hold
over unreason, or rather would discover a new reason for
protecting itself against it.

The question, for the moment, was not to suppress the
houses of confinement, but to neutralize them as potential
causes of a new evil. The problem was to organize them
while purifying them. The great reform movement that
developed in the second half of the eighteenth century
originated in the effort to reduce contamination by de-
stroying impurities and vapors, abating fermentations, pre-
venting evil and disease from tainting the air and spreading
their contagion in the atmosphere of the cities. The hos-
pital, the house of correction, all the places of confinement,
were to be more completely isolated, surrounded by a
purer air: this period produced a whole literature con-

(206)
 The Great Fear

cerning the airing of hospitals, which tentatively ap-
proaches the medical problem of contagion, but aims more
specifically at themes of moral communication. In 1776 a
decree of the Council of State appointed a commission to
determine “the degree of amelioration of which the various
hospitals in France are in need.” Viel was instructed to re-
build the wards of La Salpétriére. The ideal was an asylum
which, while preserving its essential functions, would be so
organized that the evil could vegetate there without ever
spreading; an asylum where unreason would be enurely
contained and offered as 2 spectacle, without threatening
the spectators; where it would have all the powers of ex-
ample and none of the risks of contagion. In short, an asy-
lum restored to its truth as a cage. It is this “sterilized”
confinement, if we may employ an anachronistic term, that
was still, in 1789, the dream of the Abbé Desmonceaux, in a
little work dedicated to National Benevolence; he planned
to create a pedagogical instrument—a spectacle conclu-
sively proving the drawbacks of immorality: “these
guarded asylums .. . are retreats as useful as they are
necessary. . . . The sight of these shadowy places and the
guilty creatures they contain is well calculated to preserve
from the same acts of just reprobation the deviations of a
too licentious youth; it is thus prudent of mothers and fa-
thers to familiarize their children at an early age with these
horrible and detestable places, where shame and turpitude
fetter crime, where man, corrupted in his essence, often
loses forever the rights he had acquired in society.”

Such are the dreams by which morality, in complicity
with medicine, tried to defend itself against the dangers
contained but insufficiently restricted by confinement.
These same dangers, at the same time, fascinated men’s
imaginations and their desires. Morality dreams of exorcis-
ing them, but there is something in man which makes him
dream of experiencing them, or at least of approaching

(207)

them and releasing their hallucinations. The horror that
now surrounded the fortresses of confinement also exer-
cised an irresistible attraction. Such nights were peopled
with inaccessible pleasures; such corrupt and ravaged faces
became masks of voluptuousness; against these dark land-
scapes appeared forms—pains and delights—which echoed
Hieronymus Bosch and his delirious gardens. The secrets
that escaped from the chateau in the One Hundred and
Twenty Days of Sodom have been murmured ever since:
“There, the most infamous excesses are committed upon
the very person of the prisoner; we hear of certain vices
practiced frequently, notoriously, and even publicly in the
common room of the prison, vices which the propriety of
modern times does not permit us to name. We are told that
numerous prisoners, styilligni feminis mores stuprati et con-
stupratores; that they return from this obscure, forbidden
place covered over with their own and others’ debaucher-
ies, lost to all shame and ready to commit all sorts of
crimes.”” And La Rochefoucauld-Liancourt in his turn
evoked those figures of Old Women and Young Women in
the correction wards of La Salpétriére, who from genera-
tion to generation communicate the same secrets and the
same pleasures: “The correction ward is the place of great-
est punishment for the House, containing when we visited
it forty-seven girls, most of them very young, more
thoughtless than guilty. . . . And always this confusion of
ages, this shocking mixture of frivolous girls with hardened
women who can teach them only the art of the most un-
bridled corruption.” For a long time these visions would
prowl insistently through the nights of the eighteenth cen-
tury. For a moment they would be picked out by the piti-
less light of Sade’s work and placed by it in the rigorous
geometry of Desire. They would be taken up again and
wrapped in the murky light of Goya’s Madhouse, or the
twilight that surrounds the Quinta del Sordo. How closely

(208)
 The Great Fear

the faces of the Disparates resemble them! A whole imag-
inary landscape reappears, conveyed by the Great Fear
confinement now inspires.

What the classical period had confined was not only an
abstract unreason which mingled madmen and liberunes,
invalids, and criminals, but also an enormous reservoir of
the fantastic, a dormant world of monsters supposedly en-
gulfed in the darkness of Hieronymus Bosch which had
once spewed them forth. One might say that the fortresses
of confinement added to their social role of segregation and
purification a quite opposite cultural function. Even as they
separated reason from unreason on society’s surface, they
preserved in depth the images where they mingled and ex-
changed properties. The fortresses of confinement func-
tioned as a great, long silent memory; they maintained in
the shadows an iconographic power that men might have
thought was exorcised; created by the new classical order,
they preserved, against it and against time, forbidden fig-
ures that could thus be transmitted intact from the six-
teenth to the nineteenth century. In this abolished time, the
Brocken joined Dulle Griet in the same imaginary land-
scape, and Noirceuil, the great legend of the Maréchal de
Rais. Confinement allowed, indeed called for, this resistance
of imagery.

But the images liberated at the end of the eighteenth
century were not identical at all points with those the sev-
enteenth century had tried to eliminate. Something had
happened, in the darkness, which detached them from that
secret world where the Renaissance, after the Middle Ages,
had found them; they: had lodged in the hearts, in the de-
sires, in the imaginations of men; and instead of manifesting
to sight the abrupt presence of the insane, they seethed as
the strange contradiction of human appetites: the com-
plicicy of desire and murder, of cruelty and the longing to
suffer, of sovereignty and slavery, of insult and humilia-

(209)

tion. The great cosmic conflict whose peripities had been
revealed by the Insane in the fifteenth and sixteenth cen-
turies, shifted until it became, at the end of the classical
period, a dialectic lacking the heart’s mediation. Sadism is
not a name finally given to a practice as old as Eros; it is a
massive cultural fact which appeared precisely at the end of
the eighteenth century, and which constitutes one of the
greatest conversions of Western imagination: unreason
transformed into delirium of the heart, madness of desire,
the insane dialogue of love and death in the limitless pre-
sumption of appetite. Sadism appears at the very moment
that unreason, confined for over a century and reduced to
silence, reappears, no Jonger as an image of the world, no
longer as a figura, but as language and desire. And it is no
accident that sadism, as an individual phenomenon bearing
the name of a man, was born of confinement and, within
confinement, that Sade’s entire oeuvre is dominated by the
images of the Fortress, the Cell, the Cellar, the Convent,
the inaccessible Island which thus form, as it were, the
natural habitat of unreason. It is no accident, either, that all
the fantastic literature of madness and horror, which is
contemporary with Sade’s oeuvre, takes place, preferen-
tally, in the strongholds of confinetnent. And this whole
sudden conversion of Western memory at the end of the
eighteenth century, with its possibility of rediscovering
deformed and endowed with a new meaning--figures fa-
miliar at the end of the Middle Ages: was this conversion
not authorized by the survival and the reawakening of the
fantastic in the very places where unreason had been re~
duced to silence?

In the classical period, the awareness of madness and the
awareness of unreason had not separated from one another.
The experience of unreason that had guided all the prac-
tices of confinement so enveloped the awareness of madness

(210)

 
  

The Great Fear

that it very nearly permitted it to disappear, sweeping it
along a road of regression where it was close to losing its
most specific elements.

But in the anxiety of the second half of the eighteenth
century, the fear of madness grew at the same time as the
dread of unreason: and thereby the two forms of obsession,
leaning upon each other, continued to reinforce each other. .
And at the very moment we note the liberation of the
iconographic powers that accompany unreason, we hear on
all sides complaints about the ravages of madness. Already
we are familiar with the concern generated by “nervous
diseases,” and the awareness that man becomes more deli-
cate in proportion as he perfects himself. As the century
advanced, the concern became more pressing, the warnings
more solemn. Already Raulin had observed that “since the
birch of medicine . . . these illnesses have multiplied, have
become more dangerous, more complicated, more prob-
lematical and difficult to cure.” By Tissot’s time, this gen-
eral impression became a firm belief, a sort of medical
dogma: nervous diseases “were formerly much less fre-
quent than they are nowadays; and this for two reasons:
one, that men were in general more robust, and less fre-
quently ill; there were fewer diseases of any kind; the
other, that the causes which produce nervous diseases in
especial have multiplied in a greater proportion, in recent
times, than the other general causes of illness, some of
which even seem to have diminished. . . . I do not hesitate
to say that if they were once the rarest, they are today the
most frequent.”® And soon men regained that awareness,
which had been so intense in the sixteenth century, of the
precariousness of a reason that can at any moment be com-
promised, and definitively, by madness, Matthey, a Geneva
physician very close to Rousseau’s influence, formulates the
prospect for all men of reason: “Do not glory in your state,
if you are wise and civilized men; an instant suffices to

(282)

 
   

 
 

MavNEss & CIVILIZATION

disturb and annihilate that supposed wisdom of which you
are so proud; an unexpected event, a sharp and sudden
emotion of the soul will abruptly change the most reason-
able and intelligent man into a raving idiot.” The threat of
madness resumes its place among the emergencies of the
century.

This awareness, however, has a very special style. The
obsession with unreason is a very affective one, involved in
the movement of iconographic resurrections. The fear of
madness is much freer with regard to this heritage; and
while the return of unreason has the aspect of a massive
repetition, connecting with itself outside of time, the
awareness of madness is on the contrary accompanied by a
certain analysis of modernity, which siruates it from the
start in a temporal, historical, and social context. In the
disparity between the awareness of unreason and the
awareness of madness, we have, at the end of the eighteenth
century, the point of departure for a decisive movement:
that by which the experience of unreason will continue,
with Holderlin, Nerval, and Nietzsche, to proceed ever
deeper toward the roots of time—unreason thus becoming,
par excellence, the world’s contratempo—and the know!l-
edge of madness seeking on the contrary to situate it ever
more precisely within the development of nature and his-
tory. It is after this period that the time of unreason and the
time of madness receive two opposing vectors: one being
unconditioned return and absolute submersion; the other,
on the contrary, developing according to the chronicle of a
history.*

1. Madness and Liberty. For a long time, certain forms
of melancholia were considered specifically English; this
was a fact in medicine and a constant in literature. Montes-
quieu contrasted Roman suicide, which was a form of
moral and political behavior, the desired effect of a con-
certed education, with English suicide, which had to be

(212)

 
 The Great Fear

considered as an illness since “the English kill themselves
without any apparent reason for doing so; they kill them-
selves in the very lap of happiness.” It is here that the
milieu plays its role, for if happiness in the eighteenth cen-
tury is part of the order of nature and reason, unhappiness,
or at least whatever deters from happiness without reason,
must be part of another order. This order was sought first
in the excesses of the climate, in nature’s deviation from its
equilibrium and its happy mean (temperate climates are
caused by nature; intemperate climates by the milieu). But
this was not sufficient to explain /a maladie anglaise; already
Cheyne had declared that wealth, refined food, the abun-
dance ail the inhabitants enjoyed, the life of pleasure and
ease the richest society led, were at the origin of such ner-
vous disorders. Increasingly, a political and economic ex-
planation was sought, in which wealth, progress, institu-
tions appear as the determining element of madness. At the
beginning of the nineteenth century, Spurzheim made 2
synthesis of all these analyses in one of the last texts de-
voted to them.'® Madness, “more frequent in England than
anywhere else,” is merely the penalty of the liberty that
reigns there, and of the wealth universally enjoyed. Free-
dom of conscience entails more dangers than authority and
despotism. “Religious sentiments . . . exist without re-
striction; every individual is entitled to preach to anyone
who will listen to him,” and by listening to such different
opinions, “minds are disturbed in the search for truth.”
Dangers of indecision, of an irresolute attention, of a vacil-
lating soul! The danger, too, of disputes, of passions, of
obstinacy: “Everything meets with opposition, and oppo-
sition excites the feelings; in religion, in politics, in science,
as in everything, each man is permitted to form an opinion;
but he must expect to meet with opposition.” Nor does so
much liberty permit a man to master time; every man is left
to his own uncertainty, and the State abandons all to their

(273)

 
   

    

Mavness & CIVILIZATION

fluctuations: “The English are 2 nation of merchants; a
mind always occupied with speculations is continually agi-
tated by fear and hope. Egotism, the soul of commerce,
easily becomes envious and summons other faculties to its
aid,” Besides, this liberty is far from true natural liberty: on
all sides it is constrained and harried by demands opposed
to the most legitimate desires of individuals: this is the lib-
erty of interests, of coalitions, of financial combinations,
not of man, not of minds and hearts. For financial reasons,
families are here more tyrannical than anywhere else: only
wealthy girls are able to marry; “the others are reduced to
other means of satisfaction that ruin the body and derange
the manifestations of the soul. The same cause favors
libertinage, which predisposes to madness.” A mercantile
liberty thus appears as the element in which opinion can
never arrive at the truth, in which the immediate is neces-
sarily subject to contradiction, in which time escapes the
mastery and certainty of the seasons, in which man is dis-
possessed of his desires by the laws of interest. In short,
' Hberty, far from putting man in possession of himself,
ceaselessly alienates him from his essence and his world; it
fascinates him in the absolute exteriority of other people
and of money, in the irreversible interiority of passion and
unfulfilled desire. Between man and the happiness of a
world in which he recognizes himself, between man and 2
nature in which he finds his truth, the liberty of the mer-
cantile state is “milieu”: and to this very degree it is the
determining element of madness. When Spurzheim was
writing—at the height of the Holy Alliance, during the
restoration of the authoritarian monarchies—liberalism was
readily blamed for all the sins of the world’s madness: “It is
singular to see that man’s greatest desire, which is his per-
sonal liberty, has its disadvantages as well.” But for us, the
point of such an analysis is not its critique of liberty, but its
very employment of the notion that designates for Spurz-

(2714)
  

Mavness & CIVILIZATION

crew of imaginary heroes, ethical models, or social types
embarked on a great symbolic voyage which would bring
them, if not fortune, then at least the figure of their destiny
or their truth. Thus Symphorien Champier composes a
Ship of Princes and Battles of Nobility in 1502, then a Ship
of Virtuous Ladies in 1503; there is also a Ship of Health,
alongside the Blauwe Schute of Jacob van Oestvoren in
1413, Sebastian Brant’s Narrenschiff (1494), and the work
of Josse Bade:Stultiferae naviculae scaphae fatuarum mu-
lierum (1498). Bosch’s painting, of course, belongs to this
dream fleet.

But of all these romantic or satiric vessels, the Narren-
schiff is the only one that had a real existence—for they did
exist, these boats that conveyed their insane cargo from
town to town. Madmen then led an easy wandering exist-
ence. The towns drove them outside their limits; they were
allowed to wander in the open countryside, when not en-
trusted to a group of merchants and pilgrims. The custom
was especially frequent in Germany; in Nuremberg, in the
first half of the fifteenth century, the presence of 63 mad-
men had been registered; 31 were driven away; in the fifty
years that followed, there are records of 21 more obliga-
tory departures; and these are only the madmen arrested by
the municipal authorities. Frequently they were handed
over to boatmen: in Frankfort, in 1399, seamen were in-
structed to rid the city of a madman who walked about the
streets naked; in the first years of the fifteenth century, a
criminal madman was expelled in the same manner from
Mainz. Sometimes the sailors disembarked these bothersome
passengers sooner than they had promised; witness a black-
smith of Frankfort twice expelled and twice returning be-
fore being taken to Kreuznach for good. Often the cities of
Europe must have seen these “ships of fools” approaching
their harbors.

Ic is not easy to discover the exact meaning of this cus-

(8)
 The Great Fear

heim the non-natural milieu in which the psychological and
physiological mechanisms of madness are favored, ampli-
fied, and multiplied.

2. Madness, Religion, and Time. Religious beliefs pre-
pare a kind of landscape of images, an illusory milieu f2-
vorable to every hallucination and every delirium. For 2
Iong time, doctors were suspicious of the effects of too
strict a devotion, too strong a belief. Too much moral
rigor, too much anxiety about salvation and the life to
come were often thought to bring on melancholia. The
Encyclopédie does not fail to cite such cases: “The intem-
perate impressions made by certain extravagant preachers,
the excessive fears they inspire of the pains with which our
religion threatens those who break its laws, produce aston-
ishing revolutions in weak minds. At the hospital of Mon-
télimar, several women were reported suffering from mania
and melancholia as a result of a mission held in that city;
these creatures were ceaselessly struck by the horrible
images that had thoughtlessly been presented to them; they
spoke of nothing but despair, revenge, punishment, etc.,
and one of them absolutely refused to undergo any cure,
convinced that she was in Hell and that nothing could ex-
tinguish the fire she believed was devouring her.” Pinel fol-
lows the line of these enlightened physicians—forbidding
books of devotion to be given to “melancholics by piety,”
even recommending solitary confinement for “religious
persons who believe themselves to be inspired and who seek
to make proselytes.” But this again is more of a critique
than a positive analysis: the religious object or theme is
suspected of arousing delirium and hallucination by the de-
lirious and hallucinatory nature attributed to it. Pinel re-
ports the case of a recently cured madman who had “read
in a religious book . . . that each man has his guardian
angel; on the following night, he thought he was sur-
rounded by: a choir of angels and imagined he heard celes-

(215)

 
 Mavness & CIVILIZATION

tial music and received revelations.” Religion is considered
here only as an element in the transmission of error. But
even before Pinel, there had been analyses of a more rigor-
ous historical nature, in which religion appeared as a milieu
of satisfaction or repression of the passions. In 1781 2 Ger-
man author described as happy those distant eras when
priests were endowed with absolute powers: then idleness
did not exist, every moment was marked by “ceremonies,
religious practices, pilgrimages, visits to the poor and the
sick, calendar festivals.”"" Time was thus assigned to an
organized happiness, which left no leisure for empty pas-
sions, for disgust with life, for boredom. If a man felt
guilty, he was subjected to real, often material punishment
which occupied his mind and gave him an assurance that
the transgression was redressed. And when the confessor
encountered those “hypochondriacal penitents who came
too often to confession,” he assigned them as penance ei-
ther a severe hardship that “diluted their too thick blood,”
or Jong pilgrimages: “The change of air, the length of the
road, absence from home, distance from the things which
upset them, their associations with other pilgrims, the slow
and energetic movement of walking, had more effect upon
them than the comfortable journeys . . . that in our day
take the place of pilgrimages.” Finally, the sacred nature of
the priest gave each of his injunctions an absolute value,
and no one dreamed of trying to avoid it; “usually che
whims of sick people deny all this to the physician.” For
Mocehsen, religion is the mediation between man and trans-
gression, between man and punishment: in the form of an
authoritarian synthesis, it suppresses the transgression by
imposing the punishment; if, on the contrary, religion
loosens its hold but maintains the ideal forms of remorse of
conscience, of spiritual mortification, it leads directly to
madness; only the consistency of the religious milieu can
permit man to escape alienation in the excessive delirium of

(2716)

 
 The Great Fear

transgressions. By accomplishing its rites and its require-
ments, man avoids both the useless idleness of his passions
before the transgression, and the vain repetition of his re-
morse once the transgression is committed; religion organ-
izes all human life around fulfillment of the moment. That
old religion of happier times was the perpetual celebration
of the present. But once it was idealized in the modern age,
religion cast a temporal halo around the present, an empty
milieu—that of idleness and remorse, in which the heart of
man is abandoned to its own anxiety, in which the passions
surrender time to unconcern or to repetition in which, fi-
nally, madness can function freely.

3. Madness, Civilization, and Sensibility. Civilization, in
a general way, constitutes a milieu favorable to the devel-
opment of madness. If the progress of knowledge dissipates
error, it also has the effect of propagating a taste and even a
mania for study; the life of the library, abstract specula-
tions, the perpetual agitation of the mind without the exer-
cise of the body, can have the most disastrous effects. Tis-
sot explains that in the human body it is those parts subject
to frequent work which are first strengthened and hard-
ened; among laborers, the muscles and fibers of the arms
harden, giving them their physical strength and the good
health they enjoy until an advanced age; “among men of
letters, the brain hardens; often they become incapable of
connecting their ideas,” and so are doomed to dementia.
The more abstract or complex knowledge becomes, the
greater the risk of madness. A body of knowledge still close
to what is most immediate in the senses, requiring, accord-
ing to Pressavin, only a little work on the part of the inner
sense and organs of the brain, provokes only a sort of phys-
iological happiness: “The sciences whose objects are easily
perceived by our senses, which offer the soul agreeable re-
lations because of the harmony of their consonance. . .
perform throughout the entire bodily machine a light ac-

(277)

 

 
 MapneEss & CIVILIZATION

tivity which is beneficial to all the functions.” On the con-
trary, a knowledge too poor in these sensuous relations, too
free with regard to the immediate, provokes a tension of
the brain alone which disequilibrates the whole body; sci-
ences “of things whose relationships are difficult to grasp
because they are not readily available to our senses, or be-
cause their too complicated relations oblige us to expend
great application in their study, present the soul with an
exercise that greatly fatigues the inner sense by a too con-
tinuous tension upon that organ.” Knowledge thus forms
around feeling a milieu of abstract relationships where man
risks losing the physical happiness in which his relation to
the world is usually: established. Knowledge multiplies, no
doubt, but its cost increases too. Is it certain that there are
more wise men today? One thing, at least, is certain: “rhere
are more people who have the infirmities of wisdom.” The
milieu of knowledge grows faster than knowledge itself.

But it is not only knowledge that detaches man from
feeling; it is sensibility itself: a sensibility that is no longer
controlled by the movements of nature, bur by all the hab-
its, all the demands of social life. Modern man—but woman
more than man—turns day into night and night into day:
“The moment at which our women rise in Paris is far re~
moved from that which nature has indicated; the best hours
of the day have slipped away; the purest air has disap-
peared; no one has benefited from it. The vapors, the harm-
ful exhalations, attracted by the sun’s heat, are already ris-
ing in the atmosphere; this is the hour that beauty chooses
to rise.”!? This disorder of the senses continues in the the-
ater, where illusions are cultivated, where vain passions and
the most fatal movements of the soul are aroused by arti-
fice; women especially enjoy these spectacles “that inflame
and arouse them”; their souls “are so strongly shaken that
this produces a commotion in their nerves, fleeting, in
truth, but whose consequences are usually serious; the

(278)

 
 The Great Fear

momentary loss of their senses, the tears they shed at the
performances of our modern tragedies are the least acci-
dents that can result from them.” Novels form a still
more artificial milieu, and are more dangerous to a dis-
ordered sensibility; the verisimilitude modern authors at-
tempt to produce, and all the art they employ to imitate
truth, only give more prestige to the violent and dangerous
sentiments they seek to awaken in their female readers: “In
the earliest epochs of French gallantry and manners, the
less perfected minds of women were content with facts and
events as marvelous as they were unbelievable; now they
demand believable facts yet sentiments so marvelous that
their own minds are disturbed and confounded by them,
they then seek, in all that surrounds them, to realize the
marvels by which they are enchanted; but everything
seems to them without sentiment and without life, because
they are trying to find what does not exist in nature."
The novel constitutes the milieu of perversion, par excel-
lence, of all sensibility; it detaches the soul from all that is
immediate and natural in feeling and leads it into an imag-
inary world of sentiments violent in proportion to their
unreality, and less controlled by the gentle laws of nature;
“The existence of so many authors has produced 2 host of
readers, and continued reading generates every nervous
complaint; perhaps of all the causes that have harmed
women’s health, the principal one has been the infinite mul-
tiplication of novels in the last hundred years . . . a girl
who at ten reads instead of running will, at twenty, be a
woman with the vapors and not a good nurse.”

Slowly, and still in a very scattered fashion, the eigh-
teenth century constituted, around its awareness of mad-
ness and of its threatening spread, 2 whole new order of
concepts. In the landscape of unreason where the sixteenth
century had located it, madness concealed a meaning and
an origin that were obscurely moral; its secrecy related it to

(279)

 
 Mavness & CIVILIZATION

sin, and the animality imminently perceived in it did not
make it, paradoxically, more innocent. In the second half of
the eighteenth century, madness was no longer recognized
in what brings man closer to an immemorial fall or an in-
definitely present animality; it was, on the contrary, situ-
ated in those distances man takes in regard to himself, to his
world, to all that is offered by the immediacy of nature;
madness became possible in that milieu where man’s rela-
tions with his feelings, with time, with others, are altered;
madness was possible because of everything which, in
man’s life and development, is a break with the immediate.
Madness was no longer of the order of nature or of the
Fall, but of a new order, in which men began to have a
presentiment of history, and where there formed, in an
obscure originating relationship, the “alienation” of the
physicians and the “alienation” of the philosophers—two
configurations in which man in any case corrupts his truth,
but between which the nineteenth century, after Hegel,
soon lost all trace of resemblance.

THE NEW DIVISION

Every psychiatrist, every historian yielded, at the begin-
ning of the nineteenth century, to the same impulse of in-
dignation; everywhere we find the same outrage, the same
virtuous censure: “No one blushed to put the insane in
prison.” And Esquirol, listing the fortress of Ha in Bor-
deaux, the houses of correction in Toulouse and Rennes,
the “Bicétres” still existing in Poitiers, in Caen, in Amiens,
the “Chateau” of Angers, continues: “Moreover, there are
few prisons where the raving mad are not to be found;
these unfortunates are chained in dungeons beside crim-
inals. What a monstrous association! The calm madmen are
treated worse than malefactors.”

The entire century echoes him; in England, it was the
Tukes, who had turned historians and apologists for their
ancestral occupation; in Germany, after Wagnitz, it was
Reil who groaned over those wretches “thrown, like State
criminals, into dungeons where the eye of humanity never
penetrates.” The age of positivism, for over half a century,
constantly claimed to have been the first to free the mad

(227)

 
 Mavness & CIVILIZATION

  
 
   
   
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
   
   
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
  
  
   
  

from a lamentable confusion with the felonious, to separate
the innocence of unreason from the guilt of crime.

Yet it is simple enough to show the vanity of this claim.
For years the same protests had been raised; before Reil,
there had been Franck: “Those who have visited the insane
asylums of Germany recall with dread what they have
seen. One is horrified upon entering these asylums of mis-
ery and affliction; one hears only cries of despair, yet here
dwells the man distinguished by his talents and his virtues.”
Before Esquirol, before Pinel, there had been La Rochefou-
cauld-Liancourt, there had been Tenon; and before them,
an incessant murmur throughout the eighteenth century,
composed of insistent protests, lodged year after year even
by those whom one would have thought the most indiffer-
ent, the most eager perhaps that such a confusion should
subsist. Twenty-five years before the exclamations of a
Pinel, we must invoke Malesherbes “visiting the State pris-
ons with the intention of breaking down their gates. Pris~
oners whom he found to be insane ... were sent to
houses where the society, the exercise, and the care he had
scrupulously prescribed would be sure, he said, to cure
them.” Still earlier in the century, and in a lower voice,
there had been all those directors, those bursars, those over-
seers who from generation to generation always asked and
sometimes achieved the same thing: the separation of mad-
men from convicts; there had been the Prior of La Charité
in Senlis who begged the police to remove several prisoners
and confine them instead in any of several fortresses; there
had been that overseer of the House of Correction in
Brunswick who asked--and this was only in 1713—that
the madmen not be allowed to mingle with the internees
assigned to the workshops. Had not what the nineteenth
century formulated so ostentatiously, with all the resources
of its pathos, already been whispered and indefatigably re-
peated by the eighteenth? Did Esquirol and Reil and the

(222)

 
 The New Division

Tukes do anything more than shout at the top of their
lungs what had been, for years, commonplaces of asylum
practice? The slow emigration of the mad which we have
mentioned, from 1720 to the Revolution, was probably no
more than the most visible effect of that practice.

And yet, let us listen to what was being said in this half-
silence. When the Prior of Senlis asked that madmen be
separated from certain convicts, what were his arguments?
“He is deserving of mercy, as well as cwo or three others
who would be better off in some citadel, because of the
company of six others who are mad, and who torment
them night and day.” And the meaning of this sentence
would be so clearly understood by the police chat the in-
temees in question would be set free. And the demands of
the Brunswick overseer have the same meaning: the work-
shop is disturbed by the cries and the confusion of the
insane; their frenzy is a perpetual danger, and it would be
better to send them back to the cells, or to keep them in
chains. And already, we can anticipate that from one cen~
tury to the next, the same protests did not have, at bottom,
the same value. Early in the nineteenth century, there was
indignation that the mad were not treated any better than
those condemned by common law or than State prisoners;
throughout the eighteenth century, emphasis was placed on
the fact that the prisoners deserved a better fate than one
that lumped them with the insane. For Esquirol, the scandal
is due to the fact that the mad are only mad, for the
Prior of Senlis, to the fact that the convicts are, after all,
only convicts.

A difference which is perhaps not of such significance,
and which ought to have been easily perceived. And yet, it
is necessary to emphasize it in order co understand how
the consciousness of madness was transformed in the course
of the eighteenth century. It did not evolve in the context
of a humanitarian movement that gradually related it more

(223)

 
 Mavness & CIVILIZATION

closely to the madman’s human reality, to his most affect-
ing and most intimate aspect; nor did it evolve under the
pressure of a scientific need that made it more attentive,
more faithful to what madness might have to say for itself.
If it slowly changed, it was within that simultaneously real
and artificial space of confinement. Certain imperceptible
shifts in its strucrures, or at times certain violent crises,
gradually formed the awareness of madness contemporane-
ous with the Revolution. No medical advance, no humani-
tarian approach was responsible for the fact that the mad
were gradually isolated, thar the monotony of insanity was
divided into rudimentary types. It was the depths of con-
finement itself that generated the phenomenon; it is from
confinement that we must seek an account of this new
awareness of madness.

A political more than a philanthropic awareness. For if
the eighteenth century perceived that there were among
the confined—among the libertines, the debauched, the
prodigal sons--certain men whose confusion and disorder
were of another nature, and whose anxiety was irreducible,
this perception was the result of the confined themselves.
They were the first to protest, and with the most violence.
Ministers, police officers, magistrates were assailed with the
same endless and tirelessly repeated complaints: one man
writes to Maurepas, indignant at being “forced to mingle
with madmen, some of whom are so violent that at every
moment I risk suffering dangerous abuse from them”; an-
other—the Abbé de Montcrif—makes the same complaint
to Lieutenant Berryer: “This is the ninth month that I have
been confined here in this dreadful place with fifteen or
twenty raving madmen, pell-mell with epileptics.” The far-
ther we advance into the century, the stronger grow these
protests against confinement: increasingly, madness be-
comes the specter of the internees, the very image of their
humiliation, of their reason vanquished and reduced to si-

(224)

tom. One might suppose it was a general means of extradi-
tion by which municipalities sent wandering madmen out
of their own jurisdiction; a hypothesis which will not in
itself account for the facts, since certain madmen, even be-
fore special houses were built for them, were admitted to
hospitals and cared for as such; at the Hétel-Dieu in Paris,
their cots were set up in the dormitories. Moreover, in the
majority of the cities of Europe there existed throughout
the Middle Ages and the Renaissance a place of detention
reserved for the insane; there was for example the Chatelet
of Melun or the famous Tour aux Fous in Caen; there were
the numberless Narrtiirmer of Germany, like the gates of
Liibeck or the Jungpfer of Hamburg. Madmen were thus
not invariably expelled. One might then speculate that
among them only foreigners were driven away, each city
agreeing to care for those madmen among its own citizens.
Do we not in fact find among the account books of certain
medieval cities subsidies for madmen or donations made
for the care of the insane? However, the problem is not
so simple, for there existed gathering places where the
madmen, more numerous than elsewhere, were not autoch-
thonous. First come the shrines: Saint-Mathurin de
Larchant, Saint-Hildevert de Gournay, Besancon, Gheel;
pilgrimages to these places were organized, often sup-
ported, by cities or hospitals. It is possible that these ships
of fools, which haunted the imagination of the entire
early Renaissance, were pilgrimage boats, highly symbolic
cargoes of madmen in search of their reason: some went
down the Rhineland rivers toward Belgium and Gheel;
others sailed up the Rhine toward the Jura and Besangon.
But other cities, like Nuremberg, were certainly not
shrines and yet contained great numbers of madmen—
many more, in any case, than could have been furnished by
the city itself. These madmen were housed and provided
for in the city budget, and yet they were not given treat-

lence. The day soon comes when Mirabeau recognizes in
the shameful promiscuity of madness both a subtle instru-
ment of brutality against those to be punished and the very
image of despotism, bestiality triumphant. The madman is
not the first and the most innocent victim of confinement,
but the most obscure and the most visible, the most in-
sistent of the symbols of the confining power. Tyranny
secretly persists among the confined in this lurid presence
of unreason. The struggle against the established powers,
against the family, against the Church, continues at the
very heart of confinement, in the saturnalia of reason. And
madness so well represents these punishing powers that ic
effectively plays the part of an additional punishment, a
further torment which maintains order in the uniform
chastisement of the houses of correction. La Roche-
foucauld-Liancourt bears witness to this in his report to the
Committee on Mendicitry: “One of the punishments ‘in-
flicted upon the epileptics and upon the other patients of
the wards, even upon the deserving poor, is to place them
among the mad.” The scandal lies only in the fact that the
madmen are the brutal truth. of confinement, the passive
instrument of all that is worst about it. Is this not symbol-
ized by the fact--also a commonplace of all the literature
of confinement in the eighteenth century—that a sojourn
in a house of correction necessarily leads to madness? Hav-
ing to live in this delirious world, amid the triumph of
unreason, how may one avoid joining, by the fatality of the
site and the event, the very men who are its living symbol?
“T observe that the majority of the insane confined in the
houses of correction and the State prisons have become so,
the latter through the excess of ill-treatment, the former ~
through the horror of the solitude in which they continu-
ally encounter the harassments of an imagination sharp-
ened by pain.”*

The presence of madmen among the prisoners is not the

(225)

 
   

 
   

Manvness & CIVILIZATION

scandalous limit of confinement, but its truth; not abuse,
but essence. The polemic instituted by the eighteenth cen-
tury against confinement certainly dealt with the enforced
mingling of the mad and the sane; but it did not deal with
the basic relation acknowledged between madness and con-
finement. Whatever attitude is adopted, thar, at least, is not
in question. Mirabeau, the Friend of Man, is as severe about
confinement as about the confined themselves; in his eyes,
no one confined in “the celebrated State prisons” is inno-
cent; but his place is not in these costly institutions, where
he drags out a useless life; why confine “daughters of joy
who, transported to provincial manufactories, could be-
come daughters of labor”? Or “rascals who are waiting
only for freedom in order to get themselves hanged? Why
are these people, attached to walking fetters, not employed
at those tasks which might prove harmful to voluntary
workers? They would serve as an example . . .” Once this
entire population was removed, who would remain in the
houses of confinement? Those who could not be placed
anywhere else, and who belong there by right: “Some pris-
oners of State whose crimes must not be revealed,” to
whom may be added “old men who, having consumed in
debauchery and dissipation all the fruit of their life’s labor,
and having cherished the ambitious prospect of dying in a
hospital, come there in peace”; finally, the mad, who must
wallow somewhere: “These last can vegetate anywhere.”*
Mirabeau the younger conducts his demonstration in the
opposite direction: “I formally defy anyone in the world to
prove that State prisoners, rascals, libertines, madmen,
ruined old men constitute I do not say the majority, but the
third, the fourth, the tenth part of the inhabitants of for-
tresses, houses of correction, and State prisons.” For him
the scandal is thus not that the mad are mingled with the
criminal, but that they do not constitute, together, the es-
sential part of the confined population; who then can com-

(226)
 The New Division

plain of being forced to mix with criminals? Not those who
have lost their reason forever, but those who in their youth
spent their time in wildness: “I might ask . . . why rascals
and libertines are mingled together. . . . I could ask why
young men with dangerous dispositions are left with men
who will rapidly lead them to the last degree of corrup~
tion - Finally, if this confusion of libertines and vil-
lains exes, as is all too true, why do we, by this odious,
infamous, atrocious combination, make ourselves guilty of
the most abominable of all crimes, that of leading men into
crime?” As for madmen, what other fate could be desired
for them? Neither reasonable enough not to be confined,
nor wise enough not to be treated as wicked, “it is all too
true that those who have lost the use of reason must be
hidden from society.”*

We see how the political critique of confinement func-
tioned in the eighteenth century. Not in the direction of a
liberation of the mad; nor can we say that it permitted a
more philanthropic or a greater medical attention to the
insane. On the contrary, it linked madness more firmly
than ever to confinement, and this by a double tie: one
which made madness the very symbol of the confining
power and its absurd and obsessive representative within
the world of confinement; the other which designated
madness as the object par excellence of all che measures of
confinement. Subject and object, image and goal of repres-
sion, symbol of its blind arbitrariness and justification of alk
that could be reasonable and deserved within it: by a para-
doxical circle, madness finally appears as the only reason
for a confinement whose profound unreason it symbolizes.
Still so close to this eighteenth-century notion, Michelet
would formulate it with an astonishing rigor; he returns to
the very movement of Mirabeau’s thought, apropos of the
stay the latter made at Vincennes at the same time as Sade:

First, confinement causes alienation: “Prison makes men

(227)

 
 Mavness & CIVILIZATION

mad, Those found in the Bastille and in Bicétre were stupe-
fied.”

Secondly, what is most unreasonable, most shameful,
most profoundly immoral in the tyranny of the eighteenth
century is represented in the space of confinement, and by
a madman: “We have seen the frenzies of La Salpétrigre. A
dreadful lunatic existed at Vincennes, the poisonous de
Sade, writing in the hope of corrupting the time to come.”

Thirdly, it is for this one madman alone that confine-
ment ought to have been reserved, and nothing of the kind
was done: “He was soon set free, and Mirabeau kept in
confinement.”

Hence an abyss yawns in the middle of confinement; a
void which isolates madness, denounces it for being irre-
ducible, unbearable to reason; madness now appears with
what distinguishes it from all these confined forms as well.
The presence of the mad appears as an injustice; but for
others. The undifferentiated unity of unreason had been
broken. Madness was individualized, strangely twinned
with crime, at least linked with it by a proximity which had
not yet been called into question. In this confinement
drained of a part of its content, these two figures—mad-
ness, crime—subsist alone; by themselves, they symbolize
what may be necessary about it; they alone are what hence-
forth deserves to be confined. Having taken its distance,
having finally become an assignable form in the confused
world of unreason, did not liberate madness; between mad-
ness and confinement, a profound relation had been insti-
tuted, a link which was almost one of essence.

But at the same moment, confinement suffered another,
still deeper crisis that called into question not only its re-
pressive role but its very existence; a crisis which arose not
from within, and which was not attached to political pro-

(228)

 
 The New Division

tests, but which slowly appeared on the entire social and
economic horizon.

Poverty was gradually being freed from the old moral
confusions. Men had seen unemployment assume, during
crises, an aspect that could no longer be identified with that
of sloth; had seen indigence and idleness forced to spread
into the countryside, where men had supposed they could
recognize precisely the most immediate and che purest
forms of moral life; all this revealed that poverty was per-
haps not only of the order of transgression: “Mendicity is
the fruit of poverty, which itself is the resule of accidents
occurring either in the cultivation of the land or in the
production of manufactures, or in the rise of commodity
prices, in an excess of population, etc. . . .”* Poverty had
become an economic phenomenon,

But not contingent—nor destined to be suppressed for-
ever. There was a certain quantity of indigence which man
would not succeed in eliminating—a kind of fatality of

poverty which must accompany all the forms of society to
the end of time, even where all the idle were employed:
“There need be, in a well-governed state, only those poor

born in indigence, or those who fall into it by accident.”*

This basic poverty was in a sense inalienable: birth or ac-
cident, it formed a part of life that could not be avoided.
For a long time, it was inconceivable to have a state in
which there were no paupers, so deeply did need appear to
be inscribed in man’s fate and in the structure of society:
property, labor, and poverty are terms which remain linked
in the thought of philosophers until the nineteenth century.

Necessary because it could not be suppressed, this role of
poverty was necessary too because it made wealth possible.
Because they labor and consume little, those who are in
need permit a nation to enrich itself, to set a high value on
its fields, its colonies, and its mines, to manufacture prod-

(229)

 
   

 
 

Mavwness & CIVILIZATION

ucts which will be sold the world over; in short, a people
would be poor which had no paupers. Indigence becomes
an indispensable element in the State. In it is concealed the
secret but also the real life of a society. The poor constitute
the basis and the glory of nations. And their poverty,
which cannot be suppressed, must be exalted and revered:
“My purpose is merely to attract a share of that vigilant
attention [that of the government] to the suffering portion
of the People . . .; the succor it is owed derives essentially
from the honor and the prosperity of an Empire, of which
the Poor are everywhere the firmest support, for a sover-
eign cannot preserve and extend his realm without favoring
the population, the cultivation of the Land, the Arts, and
commerce; and the Poor are the necessary agents of these
great powers which establish the true strength of a Peo-
ple.”* Here is an entire moral rehabilitation of the Pauper,
which designates, at a deeper level, a social and economic
reintegration of his role and character. In the mercantilist
economy, the Pauper, being neither producer nor con-
samer, had no place: idle, vagabond, unemployed, he be-
longed only to confinement, 2 measure by which he was
exiled and as it were abstracted from society. With the
nascent industry which needs manpower, he once again
plays a part in the body of the nation.

Thus, economic thought elaborates on new foundations
the notion of poverty. There had been the entire Christian
tradition for which the Poor Man had had a real and con- ,
crete existence, a presence of flesh and blood: an always
individual countenance of need, the symbolic passage of
God in man’s image. The abstraction of confinement had
removed the Poor Man, had identified him with other fig-
ures, enveloping him in an ethical condemnation, but had
not dissociated him from his features. The eighteenth cen-
tury discovered that “the Poor” did not exist as a concrete

(230)

 
  

 

The New Division

and final reality; that in them, two realities of different
natures had too long been confused.

On one hand, there was Poverty: scarcity of commodi-
ties and money, an economic situation linked to the state of
commerce, of agriculture, of industry. On the other, there
was Population: not a passive element subject to the fluctu-
ations of wealth, but a force which directly contributed to
the economic situation, to the production of wealth, since it
is man’s Jabor which creates—or at least transmits, shifts,
and multiplies—wealth. The “Poor Man”. was a vague no-
tion in which were combined that wealth which is Man and
the state of Need which is acknowledged as essential to
humanity. Indeed, berween Poverty and Population, there
isa rigorously inverse relation.

Physiocrats and economists are in agreement on this.
Population is in itself one of the elements of wealth, ic
forms, indeed, its certain and inexhaustible source. For
Frangois Quesnay and his disciples, man is the essential
mediation between the land and wealth: “A man is worth
as much as the land, according to an old proverb. If a man
is valueless, so is the land. With men, one doubles the land
one possesses; one clears it, one acquires it. God alone could
from the earth make a man, whereas all over the world it
has been possible to have land by means of men, or at least
the product of the land, which comes down to the same
thing. It follows that the first good is the possession of men,
and the second, of the land.”?

For the economists, the population is a good quite as
essential, if not more so, since in their view wealth is cre-
ated not only in agricultural labor, but in every industrial
transformation, and even in commercial circulation. Wealth
is linked to a labor actually effected by man: “The State
having real wealth only in the annual products of its lands
and in the industry of its inhabitants, its wealth will be at a

(237)

 
    

 
   

Mavness & CIVILIZATION

maximam when the product of each acre of land and of the
industry of each individual is raised to its maximum.”® Par-
adoxically, 2 population will be precious in proportion to
its numbers, since it will afford industry a cheap labor
force, which, by lowering the cost price, will permit a de-
velopment of production and of commerce. In this in-
finitely open labor market, the “fundamental price”—what
corresponds for Turgot to the worker's subsistence—and
the price determined by supply and demand ultimately
coincide. A nation will therefore be favored in commercial
competition to the degree that it has at its disposal the great-
est potential wealth of a numerous population.

Confinement was a gross error, and an economic mis-
take: poverty was to be suppressed by removing and main-
taining by charity a poor population. Actually, it was
poverty that was being artificially masked; and a part of
the population was being really suppressed, wealth being
always constant. Was the intention to help the poor escape
their provisional indigence? They were kept from doing
so: the labor market was limited, which was all the more
dangerous in chat this was precisely a period of crisis. On
the contrary, the high cost of products should have been
palliated by a cheap labor force, their scarcity being com-
pensated by a new industrial and agricultural effort, The
only reasonable remedy: to restore this entire population to
the circuit of production, in order to distribute it to the
points where the labor force was rarest. To utilize the
poor, vagabonds, exiles, and éyigrés of all kinds, was one of
the secrets of wealth, in the competition among nations:
“What is the best means of weakening the neighboring
states whose power and industry tend to overshadow us?”
asked Josias Tucker apropos of the emigration of the Prot-
estants. “Is it to force their subjects to remain at home by
refusing to receive and incorporate them among us, or is it

(232)
  

The New Division

to attract them to us by good wages, allowing them to
enjoy the advantages of the other citizens?”

Confinement is open to criticism because of the reper-
cussions it can have on the labor market; but still more,
because it constitutes, and with it the entire enterprise of
traditional charity, a dangerous financing. Like the Middle
Ages, the classical period had always sought to provide aid
to the poor by the system of foundations. This meant that a
share of land capital or income was thereby immobilized.
And for good, since, in the just concern to avoid the com-
mercialization of the charity enterprises, all juridical mea-
sures were taken so that these goods would never return to
circulation. But with the passage of time, their utility di-
minished; the economic situation changed, poverty altered
its aspect: “Society does not always have the same needs;
nature and the distribution of property, the division be-
tween the different orders of the people, the opinions, the
customs, the general occupations of the nation or of its
different portions, the climate itself, the diseases and other
accidents of human life undergo a continual variation; new
needs are born; others cease to make themselves felt.”® The
definitive character of the foundation was in contradiction
to the variable and indefinite rate of the accidental needs
which it was supposed to satisfy. Without the wealth
which it immobilized being restored to circulation, new
wealth had to be created as new needs appeared. The share
of funds and revenues which were set aside constantly in-
creased, thereby diminishing the productive share. Which
inevitably led to a greater poverty, hence to more numer-
ous foundations. And the process could extend indefinitely.
The moment could come when “the ever multiplying
foundations would ultimately absorb all funds and all pri-
vate property.” Upon close scrutiny, the classical forms of
aid were a cause of impoverishment, the gradual immobili-

(233)

 
   

 
   

Manvness & CIVILIZATION

zation and in a sense the slow death of all productive
wealth: “If ail the men who ever lived had had a tomb, ir
would have been quite necessary, in order to find land to
cultivate, to overturn these sterile monuments, and to stir
the ashes of the dead in order to feed the living.”

What disappeared, in the course of the eighteenth cen-
tury, was nor the inhuman rigor with which madmen were
treated, but the evident necessity of confinement, the total
unity in which they were situated without difficulty, and
those countless threads that wove them into che continuous
texture of unreason. Madness was set free long before
Pinel, not from the material constraints which kept it in the
dungeon, but from a much more binding, perhaps more
decisive servitude which kept it under the domination of
unreason’s obscure power. Even before the Revolution,
madness was free: free for a perception which individual-
ized it, free for the recognition of its unique features and
for all the operations that would finally give it its status as
an object.

Left alone, and detached from its former relations,
within the crumbling walls of confinement, madness was a
problem~raising questions it had hitherto never formu-
lated.

Above all, it embarrassed the legislator who, unable to
keep from sanctioning the end of confinement, no longer
knew at what point in the social sphere to situate it—
prison, hospital, or family aid. The measures taken imme-
diately before or after the beginning of the Revolution re-
flect this indecision.

In his circular on the lettres de cachet, Breteuil asked the
administrators to indicate the nature of the detention orders
in the various houses of confinement, and what reasons jus-
tified them. After a year or two of detention at the most,
those men were to be set free “who, having done nothing

(234)

 
  

Mavness & CIVILIZATION

ment; they were simply thrown into prison. We may sup-
pose that in certain important cities—centers of travel and
markets—madmen had been brought in considerable num-
bers by merchants and mariners and “lost” there, thus
ridding their native cities of their presence. It may have
happened that these places of “‘counterpilgrimage” have be-
come confused with the places where, on the contrary, the
insane were taken as pilgrims. Interest in cure and in exclu-
sion coincide: madmen were confined in the holy locus of a
miracle. It is possible that the village of Gheel developed in
this manner—a shrine that became a ward, a holy land
where madness hoped for deliverance, but where man
enacted, according to old themes, a sort of ritual division.

What matters is that the vagabond madmen, the act of
driving them away, their departure and embarkation do not
assume their entire significance on the plane of social utility
or security. Other meanings much closer to rite are cer-
tainly present; and we can still discern some traces of them.
Thus access to churches was denied to madmen, although
ecclesiastical law did not deny them the use of the sacra-
ments. The Church takes no action against a priest who
goes mad; but in Nuremberg in 1421 a mad priest was
expelled with particular solemnity, as if the impurity was
multiplied by the sacred nature of his person, and the city
put on its budget the money given him as a viaticum. It
happened that certain madmen were publicly whipped, and
in the course of a kind of a game they were chased in a
mock race and driven out of the city with quarterstaff
blows. So many signs that the expulsion of madmen had
become one of a number of ritual exiles.

Thus we better understand the curious implication as-
signed to the navigation of madmen and the prestige attend-
ing it. On the one hand, we must not minimize its incon-
testable practical effectiveness: to hand a madman over to
sailors was to be permanently sure he would not be prowl-

(10)
 The New Division

that could expose them to the severity of the punishments
pronounced by the laws, had abandoned themselves to the
excesses of libertinage, debauchery, and dissipation.” On
the other hand, those prisoners were to be kept in the
houses of confinement “whose minds are deranged and
whose imbecility makes them incapable of conducting
themselves in a world where their rages would make them
dangerous. With respect to these, all that is necessary is to
ascertain whether their condition is still the same, and un-
fortunately it becomes indispensable to continue their de-
tention as long as it is acknowledged that their freedom is
harmful to society, or a useless benefit to themselves.” This
was the first stage: to reduce as much as possible the prac-
tice of confinement with regard to moral transgressions,
family conflicts, the most benign aspects of libertinage, yet
to leave it untouched in its principle, and with one of its
major meanings intact: the internment of the mad. This is
the moment when madness actually takes possession of
confinement, while confinement itself is divested of its
other forms of utility.

The second stage was that of the great investigations
prescribed by the National Assembly and by the Constitu-
ent Assembly, immediately following the Declaration of
the Rights of Man: “No man may be arrested or detained
except in the cases determined by law and according to the
forms therein prescribed. . . . The law must permit only
the penalties strictly and evidently necessary, and no one
may be punished under a law established and promulgated
subsequent to the crime.” The era of confinement was
over. There remained only an imprisonment shared for the
moment by condemned or presumed criminals and the
mad. The Committee on Mendicity of the Constirutent As-
sembly designated five persons to visit the houses of con-
finement in Paris, The Duke de la Rochefoucauld-Lian-
court presented the report (December 1789); he declared

(235)

 
  

Mavness & CIVILIZATION

that the presence of madmen gave the houses of correction
a degrading aspect and was likely to reduce the inmates to 2
status unworthy of humanity; the mélange tolerated there
proved a great frivolity on the part of the authorities and .
the magistrates: “This carelessness is far from the enlight-
ened and scrupulous pity for misfortune whereby it re-

ceives all possible alleviation and consolation . . . ; in seek-
ing to succor poverty, can one ever consent to appear to
degrade humanity?”

If the mad defile those with whom they have been im-
prudently confined, a special internment must be reserved
for them; a confinement that is not medical, but that ought
to be the most efficacious and the easiest form of aid: “Of
all the misfortunes that afflict humanity, the condition of
madness is still one of those that with most reason call for
pity and respect; it is for this condition that our attentions
must with most reason be prodigal; when there is no hope
of a cure, how many means sull remain that can afford
these unfortunates at least a tolerable existence.” In. this
text, the status of madness appears in all its ambiguity: it is
necessary both to protect the confined population from its
dangers, and to grant it the benefits of a special aid.

The third stage was the great series of decrees issued
between the twelfth and the sixteenth of March 1790. In
them, the Declaration of the Rights of Man received a con-
crete application: “In the space of six weeks, beginning
with the present decree, all persons detained in fortresses,
religious houses, houses of correction, police houses, or
other prisons whatsoever, by lettres de cachet or by order
of the agents of the executive power, so long as they are
not convicted, or under arrest, or not charged with major
crimes, or confined by reason of madness, will be set at
liberty.” Confinement is thus definitively reserved for cer-
tain categories of convicted criminals and for madmen. But
for the latter, a special arrangement is in order: “Persons

(236)
 The New Division

detained for reasons of dementia will be, for the space of
three months, starting from the day of publication of the
present decree, at the suit of our procurators, interrogated
by the magistrates in the usual manner, and by virtue of
their disposition visited by physicians. who, under the su-
pervision of the directors of the district, will pronounce
upon the true circumstances of the patients in order that,
after the sentence that will have certified as to their condi-
tion, they may be released or cared for in hospitals indi-
cated for that purpose.” It appears that the choice is hence~
forth made. On March 29, 1790, Bailly, Duport-Dutertre,
and a police administrator went to La Salpétriére to deter-
mine in what manner this decree could be carried out; they
then made a similar visit to Bicétre. The difficulties were
numerous; to begin with, there existed no hospitals in-
tended or at least reserved for the mad.

In the face of these material difficulties, to which were
added certain theoretical uncertainties, a long phase of hesi-
tation was to begin. From all sides, the Assembly was asked
to provide a text which would grant protection from mad-
men even before the promised creation of the hospitals.
And by a regression, which was to be of great importance
for the future, madmen were brought under the sway of
immediate and unchecked measures adopted not even
against dangerous criminals, but against marauding beasts.
The Law of August 16-24, 1790, “entrusts to the vigilance
and authority of the municipal bodies . . . the care of ab-
viating and remedying the disagreeable events that may be
occasioned by madmen set at liberty, and by the wander-
ing of vicious and dangerous animals.” The law of July 22,
1791, reinforces this arrangement, making families respon-
sible for the supervision of the insane, and permitting the
municipal authorities to take all measures that might prove
useful: “The relatives of the insane must care for them,
prevent them from straying, and see that they do not

(237)

 
   

    

MavneEss & CIVILIZATION

commit offenses or disorders. The municipal authority
must obviate the inconvenience that may result from the
negligence with which private persons fulfill this duty.” By
this detour around their liberation, madmen regained, but
this time within the law itself, that animal status in which
confinement had seemed to isolate them; they again became
wild beasts at the very period when doctors began to at-
tribute to them a gentle animality. But even though this
legal disposition was put in the hands of the authorities, the
problems were not solved thereby; hospitals for the insane
still did not exist.

Countless requests flooded the Ministry of the Interior.
Delessart answered one of them, for example: “I feel as you
do, Monsieur, how important it is that we labor without
respite toward the establishment of houses designed to
serve as retreats for the unfortunate class of the insane.
. .. With regard to those insane persons whom the lack
of such an establishment has relegated to the various pris-
ons of your department, I do not see any other means at
present of removing them from those places so unsuited to
their state, except to transfer them temporarily, if pos-
sible, to Bicétre. It would therefore be appropriate for the
Directory to write to the Paris establishment in order to
ascertain a way to have them admitted to that house, where
the costs of their upkeep will be paid by your department
or by the communes where these unfortunates reside, if
their families are not in a position to assume that expense.”
Bicétre thus became the great center to which all che insane
‘were sent, especially once Saint-Lazare was closed. The
same was true for the women at La Salpétriére: in 1792,
two hundred madwomen were taken there who had been
installed five years previously in the former novitiate of the
Capucines on the Rue Saint-Jacques. But in the remote
provinces, there was no question of sending the insane to
the former bépitaux généraux. Generally, they were de-

(238)
 The New Division

tained in the prisons, as was the case for example at the
fortress of Ha, at the Chateau of Angers, or at Bellevaux.
The disorder in such places was indescribable, and contin-
ved for a long time—until the Empire. Antoine Nodier
gives some details about Bellevaux: “Every day, the uproar
warns the neighborhood that those confined are fighting
and persecuting one another. The guards rush upon them.
Constituted as they are today, the prison guards are the
laughingstock of the combatants. The municipal admin-
istrators are implored to intervene in order to re-establish
peace and quiet; their authority is flouted; they are shamed
and insulted; this is no longer a house of justice and deten-
tion.”

The disorders are as great, greater perhaps, at Bicétre;
political prisoners are kept there; hunted suspects are hid-
den there; poverty and famine keep many people hungry.
The administration never ceases to protest; it asks that
criminals be kept separate; and—it is important to note—
some people still suggest that, in their place of detention,
madmen be confined as well. On the ninth Brumaire, Year
Tl, the bursar of Bicétre writes to “Citizens Grandpré
and Osmond, members of the Committee on Administra-
tion and Tribunals”: “I submit that at a2 moment when
humanity is decidedly the order of the day, there is no one
who does not experience an impulse of horror upon seeing
crime and indigence united in the same asylum.” Was ic
necessary to recall the September massacres, the continual
escapes, and, for so many innocent eyes, the sight of
strangled prisoners, of swinging chains? The indigent and
the old “have before their eyes nothing but chains, bars,
and bolts. Add to this the groans of the prisoners that
sometimes reach them. . . . It is on this basis that I ur-
gently ask either that the prisoners be removed from Bi-
cétre, leaving only the indigent there, or that the indigent
be removed, leaving only the prisoners.” And here, finally,

(239)

is the decisive point, if we remember that this letter was
written in the middle of the Revolution, long before the
reports of Georges Cabanis, and several months after Pinel,
according to tradition, had “liberated” the insane of Bicécre:
“We could perhaps in this latter case leave the madmen
there, another class of unfortunates who cause horrible
suffering to humanity. . . . Make haste, then, citizens who
cherish humanity, to realize such a beautiful dream, and be
persuaded in advance that you will thereupon have deserved
well of it.” So great was the confusion of those years; so
difficult was it, at the moment when “humanity” was being
re-evaluated, to determine the place madness was to occupy
within it; so difficulr was it to situate madness in a social
sphere that was being restructured.

THE BIRTH OF
THE ASYLUM

We know the images. They are familiar in all histories of
psychiatry, where their function is to illustrate that happy
age when madness was finally recognized and treated ac-
cording to a truth to which we had too long remained blind.

“The worthy Society of Friends . . . sought to assure
those of its members who might have the misfortune to lose
their reason without a sufficient fortune to resort to expen-
sive establishments all the resources of medicine and all the
comforts of life compatible with their state; a voluntary
subscription furnished the funds, and for the last two years,
an establishment that seems to unite many advantages with
all possible economy has been founded near the city of
York. If the soul momentarily quails at the sight of that
dread disease which seems created to humiliate human rea-
son, it subsequently experiences gentler emotions when it

(247)

 
  

MADNESS & CIVILIZATION

considers all that an ingenious benevolence has been able to
invent for its care and cure.

“This house is situated a mile from York, in the midst of
a fertile and smiling countryside; it is not at all the idea of a
prison that it suggests, but rather that of a large farm; it is
surrounded by a great, walled garden. No bars, no grilles
on the windows.”?

As for the liberation of the insane at Bicétre, the story is
famous: the decision to remove the chains from the pris-
oners in the dungeons; Couthon visiting the hospital to find
out whether any suspects were being hidden; Pinel cou-
rageously going to meet him, while everyone trembled at
the sight of the “invalid carried in men’s arms.” The con-
frontation of the wise, firm philanthropist and the paralytic
monster. “Pinel immediately led him to the section for the
deranged, where the sight of the cells made a painful im-
pression on him. He asked to interrogate all the patients.
From most, he received only insults and obscene apostro-
phes. It was useless to prolong the interview. Turning to
Pinel: ‘Now, citizen, are you mad yourself to seek to un-
chain such beasts?’ Pinel replied calmly: ‘Citizen, I am
convinced that these madmen are so intractable only be-
cause they have been deprived of air and Liberty.’

“Well, do as you like with them, but I fear you may
become the victim of your own presumption.’ Whereupon,
Couthon was taken to his carriage. His departure was a
relief; everyone breathed again; the great philanthropist
immediately set to work.”?

These are images, at least insofar as each of the stories
derives the essence of its power from imaginary forms: the
patriarchal calm of Tuke’s home, where the heart's passions
and the mind’s disorders slowly subside; the lucid firmness
of Pinel, who masters in a word and a gesture the two
animal frenzies that roar against him as they hunt him
down; and the wisdom that could distinguish, between the

(242)
 The Birth of the Asylum

raving madman and the bloodthirsty member of the Con-
vention, which was the true danger: images that will carry
far—to our own day—their weight of legend.

The legends of Pinel and Tuke transmit mythical values,
which nineteenth-century psychiatry would accept as ob-
vious in nature. But beneath the myths themselves, there
was an operation, or rather a series of operations, which
silently organized the world of the asylum, the methods of
cure, and at the same time the concrete experience of mad-
ness.

Tuke’s gesture, first of all. Because it is contemporary
with Pinel’s, because he is known to have been borne along
by a whole current of “philanthropy,” this gesture is re-
garded as an act of “liberation.” The truth was quite differ-
ent: . . . there has also been particular occasion to ob-
serve the great loss, which individuals of our society have
sustained, by being put under the care of those who are not
only strangers to our principles, but by whom they are
frequently mixed with other patients, who may indulge
themselves in ill Janguage, and other exceptionable prac~
tices. This often seems to leave an unprofitable effect upon
the patients’ minds after they are restored to the use of
their reason, alienating them from those religious attach-
ments which they had before experienced; and sometimes,
even corrupting them with vicious habits to which they
had been strangers.”* The Retreat would serve as an in-
strument of segregation: a moral and religious segregation
which sought to reconstruct around madness a milieu as
much as possible like that of the Community of Quakers.
And this for two reasons: first, the sight of evil is for every
sensitive soul the cause of suffering, the origin of all those
strong and untoward passions such as horror, hate, and di-
gust which engender or perpetuate madness: “It was
thought, very justly, that the indiscriminate mixture, which

(243)

 
  

Mavness & CIVILIZATION

must occur in large public establishments, of persons of
opposite religious sentiments and practices; of the profligate
and the virtuous; the profane and the serious; was calcu-
lated to check the progress of returning reason, and to fix,
still deeper, the melancholy and misanthropic train of
ideas . . .”* But the principal reason lies elsewhere: it is
that religion can play the double role of nature and of rule,
since it has assumed the depth of nature in ancestral habie,
in education, in everyday exercise, and since it is at the
same time a constant principle of coercion. It is both spon-
taneity and constraint, and to this degree it controls the
only forces that can, in reason’s eclipse, counterbalance the
measureless violence of madness; its precepts, “where these
have been strongly imbued in early life . . . become lictle
less than principles of our nature; and their restraining
power is frequently felt, even under the delirious excite-
ment of insanity. To encourage the influence of religious
principles over the mind of the insane is considered of great
consequence, as a means of cure.”* In the dialectic of in-
sanity where reason hides without abolishing itself, religion
constitutes the concrete form of what cannot go mad; it
bears what is invincible in reason, it bears what subsists be-
neath madness as quasi-nature and around it as the constant
solicitation of a milieu “where, during lucid intervals, or
the state of convalescence, the patient might enjoy the so-
ciety of those who were of similar habits and opinions.”
Religion safeguards the old secret of reason in the presence
of madness, thus making closer, more immediate, the con-
straint that was already rampant in classical confinement.
There, the religious and moral milieu was imposed from
without, in such a way that madness was controlled, not
cured. At the Retreat, religion was part of the movement
which indicated in spite of everything the presence of rea-
son in madness, and which led from insanity to health. Re-
ligious segregation has a very precise meaning: it does not

(244)
     

  

“Stultifera Navis”

ing beneath the city walls; it made sure that he would go
far away; it made him a prisoner of his own departure. But
water adds to this the dark mass of its own values; it carries
off, but it does more: it purifies. Navigation delivers man to
the uncertainty of fate; on water, each of us is in the hands
of his own destiny; every embarkation is, potentially, the
last. It is for the other world that the madman sets sail in
his fools’ boat; it is from the other world that he comes
when he disembarks. The madman’s voyage is at once a
rigorous division and an absolute Passage. In one sense, it
simply develops, across a half-real, half-imaginary geog-
raphy, the madman’s Hminal position on the horizon of
medieval concern—a position symbolized and made real at
the same time by the madman’s privilege of being confined
within the city gates: his exclusion must enclose him; if he
cannot and must not have another prison than the thresh-
old itself, he is kept at the point of passage. He is put in the
interior of the exterior, and inversely, A highly symbolic
position, which will doubtless remain his until our own
day, if we are willing to admit that what was formerly a
visible fortress of order has now become the castle of our
conscience.

Water and navigation certainly play this role. Confined
on the ship, from which there is no escape, the madman is.
delivered to the river with its thousand arms, the sea with
its thousand roads, to that great uncertainty external to
everything. He is a prisoner in the midst of what is the
freest, the openest of routes: bound fast at the infinite
crossroads, He is the Passenger par excellence: that is, the
prisoner of the passage. And the land he will come to is
unknown-~as is, once he disembarks, the land from which
he comes. He has his truth and his homeland only in that
fruitless expanse between two countries that cannot belong
to him. Is it this ritual and these values which are at the
origin of the long imaginary relationship that can be traced

(ie)

 
 The Birth of the Asylum

attempt to preserve the sufferers from the profane presence
of non-Quakers, but to place the insane individual within a
moral element where he will be in debate with himself and
his surroundings: to constitute for him a milieu where, far
from being protected, he will be kept in a perpetual anxi-
ety, ceaselessly threatened by Law and Transgression.

“The principle of fear, which is rarely decreased by in-
sanity, is considered as of great importance in the manage-
ment of the patients.”* Fear appears as an essential presence
in the asylum. Already an ancient figure, no doubt, if we
think of the terrors of confinement. But these terrors sur-
rounded madness from the outside, marking the boundary
of reason and unreason, and enjoying a double power: over
the violence of fury in order to contain it, and over reason
itself to hold it at a distance; such fear was entirely on the
surface. The fear instituted at the Retreat is of great depth;
it passes between reason and madness like a mediation, like
an evocation of a common nature they still share, and by
which it could link them together. The terror that once
reigned was the most visible sign of the alienation of mad-
ness in the classical period; fear was now endowed with a
power of disalienation, which permitted it to restore a
primitive complicity between the madman and the man of
reason. It re-established a solidarity between them. Now
madness would never—could never—cause fear again; it
would be afraid, without recourse or return, thus entirely
in the hands of the pedagogy of good sense, of truth, and
of morality.

Samuel Tuke tells how he received at the Retreat a
maniac, young and prodigiously strong, whose seizures
caused panic in those around him and even among his
guards. When he entered rhe Retreat he was loaded with
chains; he wore handcuffs; his clothes were attached by
ropes. He had no sooner arrived than all his shackles were
removed, and he was permitted to dine with the keepers;

(245)

 
  

Mavness & CIVILIZATION

his agitation immediately ceased; “his attention appeared to
. be arrested by his new situation.” He was taken to his room;
the keeper explained that the entire house was organized in
terms of the greatest liberty and the greatest comfort for
all, and that he would not be subject to any constraint so
long as he did nothing against the rules of the house or the
general principles of human morality. For his part, the
keeper declared he had no desire to use the means of coer-
cion at his disposal. “The maniac was sensible of the kind-
ness of his treatment. He promised to restrain himself.” He
sometimes still raged, shouted, and frightened his compan-
ions. The keeper reminded him of the threats and promises
"of the first day; if he did not control himself, it would be
necessary to go back to the old ways. The patient’s agita-
tion would then increase for a while, and then rapidly de-
cline. “He would listen with attention to the persuasions
and arguments of his friendly visitor. After such conversa-
tions, the patient was generally better for some days or a
week.” At the end of four months, he left the Retreat,
entirely cured. Here fear is addressed to the invalid di-
rectly, not by instruments but in speech; there is no ques-
tion of limiting a liberty that rages beyond its bounds, but
of marking out and glorifying a region of simple responsi-
bility where any manifestation of madness will be linked to
punishment. The obscure guilt that once linked transgres-
sion and unreason is thus shifted; the madman, as 2 human
being originally endowed with reason, is no longer guilty
of being mad; buc the madman, as a madman, and in the
interior of that disease of which he is no longer guilty, must
feel morally responsible for everything within him chat
may disturb morality and society, and must hold no one
but himself responsible for the punishment he receives. The
assignation of guilt is no longer the mode of relation that
obtains between the madman and the sane man in their
generality; it becomes both the concrete form of coexist-

(246)
 The Birth of the Asylum

ence of each madman with his keeper, and the form of
awareness that the madman must have of his own madness.

We must therefore re-evaluate the meanings assigned to
Tuke’s work: liberation of the insane, abolition of con-
straint, constitution of a human milieu—these are only
justifications. The real operations were different. In fact
Tuke created an asylum where he substituted for the free
terror of madness the stifling anguish of responsibility; fear
no longer reigned on the other side of the prison gates, it
now raged under the seals of conscience. Tuke now trans-
ferred the age-old terrors in which the insane had been
trapped to the very heart of madness. The asylum no
longer punished the madman’s guilt, it is true; but it did
more, it organized that guilt; it organized it for the madman
as 2 consciousness of himself, and as a non-reciprocal rela-
tion to the keeper; it organized it for the man of reason as
an awareness of the Other, a therapeutic intervention in the
madman’s existence. In other words, by this guilt the mad-
man became an object of punishment always vulnerable to
himself and to the Other; and, from the acknowledgment
of his status as object, from the awareness of his guilt, the
madman was to return to his awareness of himself as a free
and responsible subject, and consequently to reason, This
movement by which, objectifying himself for the Other,
the madman thus returned to his liberty, was to be found as
much in Work as in Observation.

Let us not forget that we are in a Quaker world where
God blesses men in the signs of their prosperity. Work
comes first in “moral treatment” as practiced at the Retreat.
In itself, work possesses a constraining power superior to all
forms of physical coercion, in that the regularity of the
hours, the requirements of attention, the obligation to pro-
duce a result detach the sufferer from a liberty of mind that
would be fatal and engage him in a system of responsibili-
ties: “Regular employment is perhaps the most generally

(247)

 
  

Mavness & CIVILIZATION

efficacious; and those kinds of employment are doubtless to
be preferred, both on a moral and physical account, which
are accompanied by considerable bodily action; that are
most agreeable to the patient and which are most opposite
to the illusions of his disease.”? Through work, man re-
turns to the order of God’s commandments; he submits his
liberty to laws.that are those of both morality and reality.
Hence mental work is not to be rejected; yet with absolute
rigor, all exercises of the imagination must be excluded as
being in complicity with the passions, the desires, or all
delirious illusions. On the contrary, the study of what is
eternal in nature and most in accord with the wisdom and
goodness of Providence has the greatest efficacity in reduc-
ing the madman’s immoderate liberties and bringing him to
discover the forms of his responsibility. “The various
branches of the mathematics and natural science furnish the
most useful class of subjects on which to employ the minds
of the insane.” In the asylum, work is deprived of any
productive value; it is imposed only as 2 moral rule; a lim-
itation of liberty, a submission to order, an engagement of
responsibility, with the single aim of disalienating the mind
lost in the excess of a liberty which physical constraint
limits only in appearance.

Even more efficacious than work, than the observation
of others, is what Tuke calls “the need for esteem”: “This
principle in the human mind, which doubtless influences in
a great degree, though often secretly, our general manners;
and which operates with peculiar force on our introduction
into a new circle of acquaintance.” In classical confinement,
the madman was also vulnerable to observation, but such
observation did not, basically, involve him; it involved only
his monstrous surface, his visible animality; and ic included
at least one form of reciprocity, since the sane man could
read in the madman, as in a mirror, the imminent movement
of his downfall. The observation Tuke now instituted as

(248)
 The Birth of the Asylum

one of the great elements of asylum existence was both
deeper and less reciprocal. It pursued in the madman the
least perceptible signs of his madness, in the place where
madness becomes secretly distinct from reason, begins to
detach itself from it; and the madman cannot return this
observation in any form, since he is merely observed; he is
a kind of new arrival, a latecomer in the world of reason.
Tuke organized an entire ceremonial around these observa~
tions. There were social occasions in the English manner,
where everyone was obliged to imitate all the formal re-
quirements of social existence; nothing else circulated ex-
cept the observation that would spy out any incongruity,
any disorder, any awkwardness where madness might be-
tray itself. The directors and staff of the Retreat thus regu-
larly invited several patients to “‘tea-parties”; the guests
“dress in their best clothes, and vie with each other in po-
liteness and propriety, The best fare is provided, and the
visitors are treated with all the attention of strangers. The
evening generally passes with the greatest harmony and
enjoyment. It rarely happens that any unpleasant circum-
stance occurs; the patients control, to a wonderful degree,
their different propensities; and the scene is at once curious
and affectingly gratifying.” Curiously, this rite is not one of
intimacy, of dialogue, of mutual acquaintance; it is the or-
ganization around the madman of a world where every-
thing would be like and near him, but in which he himself
would remain a stranger, the Stranger par excellence who is
judged not only by appearances but by all that they may
betray and reveal in spite of themselves. Incessantly cast in
this empty role of unknown visitor, and challenged in
everything that can be known about him, drawn to the
surface of himself by a social personality silently imposed
by observation, by form and mask, the madman is obliged
to objectify himself in the eyes of reason as the perfect
stranger, that is, as the man whose strangeness does not

(249)

 
  

Manpness & CIVILIZATION

reveal itself. The city of reason welcomes him only with
this qualification and at the price of this surrender to
anonymity.

We see that at the Retreat the partial suppression of
physical constraint was part of a system whose essential
element was the constitution of a “self-restraine” in which
the patient’s freedom, engaged by work and the observa-
tion of others, was ceaselessly threatened by the recogni-
tion of guilt. Instead of submitting to a simple negative
operation that loosened bonds and delivered one’s deepest
nature from madness, it must be recognized that one was in
the grip of a positive operation that confined madness in a
system of rewards and punishments, and included it in the
movement of moral consciousness. A passage from a world
of Censure to a universe of Judgment. But thereby a psy-
chology of madness becomes possible, for under observa-
tion madness is constantly required, at the surface of itself,
to deny its dissimulation. It is judged only by its acts; it is
not accused of intentions, nor are its secrets to be fath-
omed. Madness is responsible only for that part of itself
which is visible. All the rest is reduced to silence. Madness
no longer exists except as seen. The proximity instiruted by
the asylum, an intimacy neither chains nor bars would ever
violate again, does not allow reciprocity: only the nearness
of observation that watches, that spies, that comes closer in
order to see better, but moves ever farther away, since it
accepts and acknowledges only the values of the Stranger.
The science of mental disease, as it would develop in the asy-
lum, would always be only of the order of observation and
classification, It would not be a dialogue. It could not be
that until psychoanalysis had exorcised this phenomenon of
observation, essential to the nineteenth-century asylum.
and substituted for its silent magic the powers of language.
It would be fairer to say that psychoanalysis doubled the
absolute observation of the watcher with the endless mono-

(250)
 The Birth of the Asylum

logue of the person watched—thus preserving the old asy-
lum structure of non-reciprocal observation but balancing
it, in a non-symmetrical reciprocity, by the new structure
of language without response.

Surveillance and Judgment: already the outline appears
of a new personage who will be essential in the nineteenth-
century asylum. Tuke himself suggests this personage,
when he tells the story of a maniac subject to seizures of
irrepressible violence. One day while he was walking in the
garden of the asylum with the keeper, this patient suddenly
entered a phase of excitation, moved several steps away,
picked up a large stone, and made the gesture of throwing
it at his companion. The keeper stopped, looked the patient
in the eyes; then advanced several steps toward him and “in
a resolute tone of voice . . . commanded him to lay down
the stone”; as he approached, the patient lowered his hand,
then dropped his weapon; “he then submitted to be quietly
led to his apartment.” Something had been born, which
was no longer repression, but authority. Until the end of
the eighteenth century, the world of madmen was peopled
only by the abstract, faceless power which kept them con-
fined; within these limits, it was empty, empty of all that
was not madness itself; the guards were often recruited
among the inmates themselves. Tuke established, on the
contrary, a mediating element between guards and patients,
between reason and madness. The space reserved by soci-
ety for insanity would now be haunted by those who were
“from the other side” and who represented both the pres-
tige of the authority that confines and the rigor of the
reason that judges. The keeper intervenes, without weap-
ons, without instruments of constraint, with observation
and language only; he advances upon madness, deprived of
all that could protect him or make him seem threatening,
risking an immediate confrontation without recourse. In
fact, though, it is not as a concrete person that he confronts

(2s7)

 
  

Mavness & CIVILIZATION

madness, but as a reasonable being, invested by that very
fact, and before any combat takes place, with the authority
that is his for not being mad. Reason’s victory over unrea-
son was once assured only by material force, and in a sort
of real combat. Now the combat was always decided be-
forehand, unreason’s defeat inscribed in advance in the
concrete situation where madman and man of reason meet.
The absence of constraint in the nineteenth-century asy-
lum is not unreason liberated, but madness long since mas-
tered,

For this new reason which reigns in the asylum, madness
does not represent the absolute form of contradiction, but
instead a minority status, an aspect of itself that does not
have the right to autonomy, and can live only grafted onto
the world of reason. Madness is childhood. Everything at
the Retreat is organized so that the insane are transformed
into minors. They are regarded “‘as children who have an
overabundance of strength and make dangerous use of it.
They must be given immediate punishments and rewards;
whatever is remote has no effect on them. A new system of
education must be applied, a new direction given to their
ideas; they must first be subjugated, then encouraged, then
applied to work, and this work made agreeable by attrac-
tive means.” For a long time already, the law had regarded
the insane as minors, but this was a juridical situation, ab-
stractly defined by interdiction and trusteeship; it was not a
concrete mode of relation between man and man. Minority
status became for Tuke a style of existence to be applied to
the mad, and for the guards a mode of sovereignty. Great
emphasis was placed on the concept of the “family” which
organized the community of the insane and their keepers at
the Retreat. Apparently this “family” placed the patient in
a milieu both normal and natural; in reality it alienated him
still more: the juridical minority assigned to the madman
was intended to protect him as a subject of law; this ancient

- (252)
 The Birth of the Asylum

structure, by becoming a form of coexistence, delivered
him entirely, as a psychological subject, to the authority
and prestige of the man of reason, who assumed for him the
concrete figure of an adult, in other words, both domina-
tion and destination.

In the great reorganization of relations between madness
and reason, the family, at the end of the eighteenth cen-
tury, played a decisive part—simultaneously imaginary land-
scape and real social structure; it is from the family that
Tuke starts out, and toward it that he progresses. Lending
it the prestige of primitive values not yet compromised in
the social, Tuke makes the family play a role of disaliena-
tion; it was, in his myth, the antithesis of that “milieu”
which the eighteenth century saw as the origin of all mad-
ness. But he introduced it as well, in a very real way, into
the world of the asylum, where it appears both as truth and
as norm for all relations that may obtain between the mad-
man and the man of reason. Thus minority under family
tutelage, a juridical status in which the madman’s civil status
is alienated, becomes a concrete situation in which his con-
crete liberty is alienated. The entire existence of madness,
in the world now being prepared for it, was enveloped in
what we may call, in anticipation, a “parental complex.”
The prestige of patriarchy is revived around madness in the
bourgeois family. It is this historical sedimentation which
psychoanalysis would later bring to light, according it
through a new myth the meaning of a destiny that sup-
posedly marked all of Western culture and perhaps all civi-
lization, whereas it had been slowly deposited by it and
only solidified quite recently at the turn of this century,
when madness was doubly alienated within the family—by
the myth of a disalienation in patriarchal purity, and by 2
truly alienating situation in an asylum constituted in the
family mode. Henceforth, and for a period of time the end
of which it is not yet possible to predict, the discourse of

(253)

 
  

Manvness & CIVILIZATION

unreason will be indissociably linked with the half-real, half-
imaginary dialectic of the Family. So that what, in their
violence, it was once obligatory to interpret as profanations
‘or blasphemies, it would henceforth be necessary to see as
an incessant attack against the Father. Thus in the modern
world, what had been the great, irreparable confrontation
of reason and unreason became the secret thrust of instincts
against the solidity of the family instirution and against its
most archaic symbols.

There is an astonishing convergence of the movement of
fundamental institutions and this evolution of madness in
the world of confinement. The liberal economy, as we have
seen, tended to entrust the care of the poor and the sick to
the family rather than to the State: the family thus became
the site of social responsibility. But if the patient can be
entrusted to the family, he is nonetheless mad, which is too
strange and inhuman. Tuke, precisely, reconstitutes around
madness a simulated family, which is an institutional par-
ody but a real psychological situation. Where the family is
inadequate, he substitutes for it a fictitious family decor of
signs and attitudes. But by a very curious intersection, the
day would come when the family was relieved of its re-
sponsibility to care for the patient in general, while it kept
the fictitious values that concern madness; and long after
the diseases of the poor had again become an affair of state,
the asylum would keep the insane in the imperative fiction
of the family; the madman remains a minor, and for a long
time reason will retain for him the aspect of the Father.

Closed upon these fictitious values, the asylum was pro-
tected from history and from social evolution. In Tuke’s
mind, the problem was to constitute a milieu which would
imitate the oldest, the purest, the most natural forms of
coexistence; the most human milieu possible, while being
the least social one possible. In fact, he isolated the social

through the whole of Western culture? Or is it, con-
versely, this relationship that, from time immemorial, has
called into being and established the rite of embarkation?
One thing at least is certain: water and madness have long
been linked in the dreams of European man,

Already, disguised as 2 madman, Tristan had ordered
boatmen to land him on the coast of Cornwall. And when
he arrived at the castle of King Mark, no one recognized
him, no one knew whence he had come. But he made too
many strange remarks, both familiar and distant; he knew
too well the secrets of the commonplace not to have been
from another, yet nearby, world. He did not come from the
solid land, with its solid cities; but indeed from the ceaseless
unrest of the sea, from those unknown highways which
conceal so much strange knowledge, from that fantastic
plain, the underside of the world. Iseut, first of all, realized
that this madman was a son of the sea, and that insolent
sailors had cast him here, a sign of misfortune: “Accursed
be the sailors that brought this madman! Why did they not
throw him into the sea!”* And more than once in the
course of time, the same theme reappears: among the mys-
tics of the fifteenth century, it has become the motif of the _
soul as a skiff, abandoned on the infinite sea of desires, in
the sterile field of cares and ignorance, among the mirages
of knowledge, amid the unreason of the world—a craft at
the mercy of the sea’s great madness, unless it throws out a
solid anchor, faith, or raises its spiritual sails so that the
breath of God may bring it to port. At the end of the
sixteenth century, De Lanere sees in the sea the origin of
the demoniacal leanings of an entire people: the hazardous
labor of ships, dependence on the stars, hereditary secrets,
estrangement from women—the very image of the great,
turbulent plain itself makes man lose faith in God and all
his attachment to his home; he is then in the hands of the
Devil, in the sea of Satan’s ruses.* In the classical period,

ically in the asylum, and set it adrife in history. The asy-
lum, always oriented to anachronistic structures and sym-
bols, would be, par excellence, inadapted and out of time.
And exactly where animality manifested a presence with-
out history, an eternal return, would slowly reappear the
immemorial scars of old hatreds, old family profanations,
the forgotten signs of incest and punishment.

Pinel advocates no religious segregation. Or rather, a
segregation that functions in the opposite direction from
that practiced by Tuke. The benefits of the renovated asy-
lum were offered to all, or almost all, except the fanatics
“who believe themselves inspired and seek to make con-
verts.” Bicétre and La Salpétritre, according to Pinel’s in-
tention, form a complementary figure co the Retreat.

Religion must not be the moral substratum of life in the
asylum, but purely and simply a medical object: “Religious
opinions in a hospital for the insane must be considered only
in a strictly medical relation, that is, one must set aside all
other considerations of public worship and political belief,
and investigate only whether it is necessary to oppose the
exaltation of ideas and feelings that may originate in this
source, in order to effect the cure of certain alienated
minds.”® A source of strong emotions and terrifying im-
ages which it arouses through fears of the Beyond, Cathol-
icism frequently provokes madness; it generates delirious
beliefs, entertains hallucinations, leads men to despair and
to melancholia. We must not be surprised if, “examining
the registers of the insane asylum at Bicétre, we find in-
scribed there many priests and monks, as well as country
people maddened by a frightening picture of the future.”
Sull less surprising is it to see the number of religious mad-
nesses vary. Under the Old Regime and during the Revolu-
tion, the strength of superstitious beliefs, or the violence of
the struggles in which the Republic opposed the Catholic

(255)

 
  

Mavwness & CIVILIZATION

Church, multiplied melancholias of religious origin. With
the return of peace, the Concordat having erased the
struggles, these forms of delirium disappeared; in the Year
X, so per cent of the melancholics in Bicétre were suffering
from religious madness, 33 per cent the following year, and
only 18 per cent in the Year XIL. The asylum must thus be
freed from religion and from all its iconographic connec-
tions; “‘melancholics by devotion” must not be allowed
their pious books; experience “teaches that this is the surest
means of perpetuating insanity or even of making it in-
curable, and the more such permission is granted, the less
‘we manage to calm anxiety and scruples.” Nothing takes us
further from Tuke and his dreams of a religious com-
munity that would at the same time be a privileged site of
mental cures, than this notion of a neutralized asylum, puri-
fied of those images and passions to which Christianity gave
birth and which made the mind wander toward illusion,
toward error, and soon toward delirium and hallucinations,

Bur Pinel’s problem was to reduce the iconographic
forms, not the moral content of religion. Once “filtered,”
religion possesses a disalienating power that dissipates the
images, calms the passions, and restores man to what is most
immediate and essential: it can bring him closer to his moral
truth. And it is here that religion is often capable of effect-
ing cures. Pinel relates several Voltairean stories. One, for
example, of a woman of twenty-five, “of strong constitu-
tion, united in wedlock to a weak and delicate man”; she
suffered “quite violent fits of hysteria, imagining she was
possessed by a demon who followed her in different shapes,
sometimes emitting bird noises, sometimes mournful sounds
and piercing cries.” Happily, the local curé was more con-
cerned with natural religion than learned in the techniques
of exorcism; he believed in curing through the benevolence
ot nature; this “enlightened man, of kindly and persuasive
character, gained ascendancy over the patienc’s mind and

(256)
 The Birth of the Asylum

managed to induce her to leave her bed, to resume her
domestic tasks, and even to spade her garden. . . . This
was followed by the most fortunate effects, and by a cure
that lasted three years.” Restored to the extreme simplicity
of this moral content, religion could not help conniving
with philosophy and with medicine, with all the forms of
wisdom and science that can restore the reason in a dis-
turbed mind. There are even instances of religion serving as
a preliminary treatment, preparing for what will be done in
the asylum: take the case of the young girl “of an ardent
temperament, though very docile and pious” who was torn
between “the inclinations of her heart and the severe prin-
ciples of her conduct”; her confessor, after having vainly
counseled her to attach herself to God, proposed examples
of a firm and measured holiness, and “offered her the best
remedy against high passions: patience and time.” Taken to
La Salpétriére, she was treated, on Pinel’s orders, “‘accord-
ing to the same moral principles,” and her illness proved
“of very short duration.” Thus the asylum assimilates not
the social theme of a religion in which men feel themselves
brothers in the same communion and the same community,
but the moral power of consolation, of confidence, and a
docile fidelity to nature. It must resume the moral enter-
prise of religion, exclusive of its fantastic text, exclusively
on the level of virtue, labor, and social life.

The asylum is a religious domain without religion, a
domain of pure morality, of ethical uniformity, Everything
that might retain the signs of the old differences was elimi-
nated. The last vestiges of rite were extinguished. Formerly
the house of confinement had inherited, in the social
sphere, the almost absolute limits of the lazar house; it was a
foreign country. Now the asylum must represent the great
continuity of social morality. The values of family and
work, all the acknowledged virtues, now reign in the asy-
lum. But their reign is a double one, First, they prevail in

(257)

 
  
 

Mavness & CIVILIZATION

fact, at the heart of madness itself; beneath the violence and
disorder of insanity, the solid nature of the essential virtues
is not disrupted, There is a primitive morality which is
ordinarily not affected even by the worst dementia; it is
this morality which both appears and functions in the cure:
“I can generally testify to the pure virtues and severe prin-
ciples often manifested by the cure. Nowhere except in
novels have I seen spouses more worthy of being cherished,
parents more tender, lovers more passionate, or persons
more attached to their duties than the majority of the in-
sane fortunately brought to the period of convalescence.”**
This inalienable virtue is both the truth and the resolution
of madness, Which is why, if it reigns, ic must reign as well.
The asylum reduces differences, represses vice, eliminates
irregularities. It denounces everything that opposes the es-
sential virtues of society: celibacy—“the number of girls
fallen into idiocy is seven times greater than the num-
ber of married women for the Year XI and the Year XIII;
for dementia, the proportion is two to four times greater,
we can thus deduce that marriage constirutes for women a
kind of preservative against the two sorts of insanity which
are most inveterate and most often incurable”; debauchery,
misconduct, and “extreme perversity of habits”—“vicious
habits such as drunkenness, limitless promiscuity, an apa-
thetic lack of concern can gradually degrade the reason and
end in outright insanity”; laziness—“it is the most constant
and unanimous result of experience that in all public asy-
Jums, as in prisons and hospitals, the surest and perhaps the
sole guarantee of the maintenance of health and good habits
and order is the law of rigorously executed mechanical
work.” The asylum sets itself the task of the homogeneous
rule of morality, its rigorous extension to all those who
tend to escape from it.

But it thereby generates an indifference; if the law does

(258)

 

  
 The Birth of the Asylum

not reign universally, it is because there are men who do
not recognize it, a class of society that lives in disorder, in
negligence, and almost in illegality: “If on the one hand we
see families prosper for a long series of years in the bosom
of harmony and order and concord, how many others, es-
pecially in the lower classes, afflict the cye with a repulsive
spectacle of debauchery, of dissensions, and shameful dis-
tress! That, according to my daily notes, is the most fertile
source of the insanity we treat in the hospitals.”*

In one and the same movement, the asylum becomes, in
Pinel’s hands, an instrument of moral uniformity and of
social denunciation. The problem is to impose, in a univer-
sal form, a morality that will prevail from within upon
those who are strangers to it and in whom insanity is al-
ready present before it has made itself manifest. In the first
case, the asylum must act as an awakening and a reminder,
invoking a forgotten nature; in the second, it must act by
means of a social shift in order to snatch the individual
from his condition, The operation as practiced at the Re-
treat was still simple: religious segregation for purposes of
moral purification. ‘The operation as practiced by Pinel was
relatively complex: to effect moral syntheses, assuring an
ethical continuity between the world of madness and the
world of reason, but by practicing a social segregation that
would guarantee bourgeois morality a universality of fact
and permit it to be imposed as a law upon all forms of
insanity.

In the classical period, indigence, laziness, vice, and mad-
ness mingled in an equal guilt within unreason, madmen
were caught in the great confinement of poverty and un-
employment, but all had been promoted, in the proximity
of transgression, to the essence of a Fall. Now madness
belonged to social failure, which appeared without distinc-
tion as its cause, model, and limit. Half a century later,

(259)

 
  

Maoness & CIVILIZATION

mental disease would become degeneracy. Henceforth, the
essential madness, and the really dangerous one, was that
which rose from the lower depths of society.

Pinel’s asylum would never be, as a retreat from the
world, a space of nature and immediate truth like Tuke’s,
’ but a uniform domain of legislation, a site of moral syn-
theses where insanities born on the outer limits of society
were eliminated, The entire life of the inmates, the entire
conduct of their keepers and doctors, were organized by
Pinel so that these moral syntheses would function. And
this by three principal means:

1. Silence. The fifth chained prisoner released by Pinel
was a former ecclesiastic whose madness had caused hin to
be excommunicated; suffering from delusions of grandeur,
he believed he was Christ; this was “the height of human
arrogance in delirium.” Sent to Bicétre in 1782, he had been
in chains for twelve years. For the pride of his bearing, the
grandiloquence of his ideas, he was one of the most cele-
brated spectacles of the entire hospital, but as he knew that
he was reliving Christ’s Passion, “he endured with patience
this long martyrdom and the continual sarcasms his mania
exposed him to.” Pinel chose him as one of the first twelve
to be released, though his delirium was still acute. But Pinel
did not treat him as he did the others; without a word, he
had his chains struck off, and “ordered expressly that
everyone imitate his own reserve and not address a word to
this poor madman. This prohibition, which was rigorously
observed, produced upon this self-intoxicated creature an
effect much more perceptible than irons and the dungeon;
he felt humiliated in an abandon and an isolation so new to -
him amid his freedom. Finally, after long hesications, they
saw him come of his own accord to join the society of the
other patients; henceforth, he returned to more sensible
and true ideas.””

Deliverance here has a paradoxical meaning. The dun-

(260)
  

The Birth of the Asylum

geon, the chains, the continual spectacle, the sarcasms were,
to the sufferer in his delirium, the very element of his lib-
erty. Acknowledged in that very fact and fascinated from
without by so much complicity, he could not be dislodged
from his immediate truth. But the chains rhat fell, the in-
difference and silence of all those around him confined
him in the limited use of an empty liberty; he was delivered
in silence to a truth which was not acknowledged. and
which he would demonstrate in vain, since he was no
longer a spectacle, and from which he could derive no ex-
altation, since he was not even humiliated. It was the man
himself, not his projection in a delirium, who was now
humiliated: for physical constraint yielded to a liberty that
constantly touched the limits of solitude; the dialogue of
delirium and insult gave way to a monologue in a language
which exhausted itself in the silence of others; the entire
show of presumption and outrage was replaced by in-
difference. Henceforth, more genuinely confined than he
could have been in a dungeon and chains, a prisoner of
nothing but himself, the sufferer was caught in a relation to
himself that was of the order of transgression, and in a non-
relation to others that was of the order of shame, The oth-
ers are made innocent, they are no longer persecutors, the
guilt is shifted inside, showing the madman that he was
fascinated by nothing but his own presumption; the enemy
faces disappear; he no longer feels theit presence as ob-
servation, but as a denial of attention, as observation de-
flected; the others are now nothing but a limit that cease-
lessly recedes as he advances. Delivered from his chains, he
is now chained, by silence, to transgression and to shame.
He feels himself punished, and he sees the sign of his in-
nocence in that fact; free from all physical punishment, he
must prove himself guilty. His torment was his glory; his
deliverance must humiliate him.

Compared to the incessant dialogue of reason and mad-

(2617)

 
  

Mavness & CIVILIZATION

ness during the Renaissance, classical internment had been a
silencing. But it was not total: language was engaged in
things rather than really suppressed. Confinement, prisons,
dungeons, even tortures, engaged in a mute dialogue be-
tween reason and unreason—the dialogue of struggle. This
dialogue itself was now disengaged; silence was absolute;
there was no longer any common language between mad-
ness and reason; the language of delirium can be answered
only by an absence of language, for delirium is not a frag-
ment of dialogue with reason, it is not language at all; it
refers, in an ultimately silent awareness, only to transgres-
sion. And it is only at this point that a common language
becomes possible again, insofar as it will be one of acknowl-
edged guilt, “Finally, after long hesitations, they saw him
come of his own accord to join the society of the other
patients . . .” The absence of Janguage, as a fundamental
structure of asylum life, has its correlative in the exposure
of confession. When Freud, in psychoanalysis, cautiously
reinstitutes exchange, or rather begins once again to listen
to this language, henceforth eroded into monologue, should
we be astonished that the formulations he hears are always
those of transgression? In this inveterate silence, transgres-
sion has taken over the very sources of speech,

2. Recognition by Mirror, At the Retreat, the madman
was observed, and knew he was observed; but except for
that direct observation which permitted only an indirect
apprehension of itself, madness had no immediate grasp of
its own character. With Pinel, on the contrary, observation
operated only within the space defined by madness, with-
out surface or exterior limits. Madness would see itself,
would be seen by itself—-pure spectacle and absolute subject.

“Three insane persons, each of whom believed himself to
be a king, and each of whom took the title Louis XVI,
quarreled one day over the prerogatives of royalty, and
defended them somewhat too energetically. The keeper ap-

(262)
 The Birth of the Asylum

proached one of them, and drawing him aside, asked:
‘Why do you argue with these men who are evidently
mad? Doesn’t everyone know that you should be recog-
nized as Louis XVI?’ Flattered by this homage, the mad-
man immediately withdrew, glancing at the others with a
disdainful hauteur. The same trick worked with the second
patient. And thus in an instant there no longer remained
any trace of an argument.” This is the first phase, that of
exaltation. Madness is made to observe itself, but in others:
it appears in them as a baseless pretense—in other words, as
absurd. However, in this observation that condemns others,
the madman assures his own justification and the certainty
of being adequate to his delirium. The rift between pre-
sumption and reality allows itself to be recognized only in
the object. It is entirely masked, on the contrary, in the
subject, which becomes immediate truth and absolute
judge: the exalted sovereignty that denounces the others’
false sovereignty dispossesses them and thus confirms itself
in the unfailing plenitude of presumption. Madness, as
simple delirium, is projected onto others; as perfect uncon-
sciousness, it is entirely accepted.

It is at this point that the mirror, as an accomplice, be-
comes an agent of demystification. Another inmate of Bi-
cétre, also believing himself a king, always expressed him-
self “in a tone of command and with supreme authority.”
One day when he was calmer, the keeper approached him
and asked why, if he were a sovereign, he did not put an
end to his detention, and why he remained mingled with
madmen of all kinds. Resuming this speech the following
days, “he made him see, little by little, the absurdity of his
pretensions, showed him another madman who had also
been long convinced that he possessed supreme power and
had become an object of mockery. At first the maniac felt
shaken, soon he cast doubts upon his title of sovereign, and
finally he came to realize his chimerical vagaries. It was in

(263)

 
  
   

Mavness & CIVILIZATION

two weeks that this unexpected moral revolution took
place, and after several months of tests, this worthy father
‘was restored to his family.”'* This, then, is the phase of
abasement: presumptuously identified with the object of
his delirium, the madman recognizes himself as in a mirror
in this madness whose absurd pretensions he has de-
nounced; his solid sovereignty as a subject dissolves in this
object he has demystified by accepting it. He is now piti-
lessly observed by himself. And in the silence of those who
represent reason, and who have done nothing but hold up
the perilous mirror, he recognizes himself as objectively
mad. ‘
We have seen by what means—and by what mystifica-
tions—eighteenth-century therapeutics tried to persuade
the madman of his madness in order to release him from it.
Here the movement is of an entirely different nature; it is
not 2 question of dissipating error by the impressive spec-
tacle of a truth, even a pretended truth; but of treating
madness in its arrogance rather than in its aberration. The
classical mind condemned in madness 2 certain blindness to
the truth; from Pinel on, madness would be regarded rather
as an impulse from the depths which exceeds the juridical
limits of the individual, ignores the moral limits fixed for
him, and tends to an apotheosis of the self. For the nine-
teenth century, the initial model of madness would be to
believe oneself to be God, while for the preceding centuries
it had been to deny God. Thus madness, in the spectacle of
itself as unreason humiliated, was able to find its salvation
when, imprisoned in the absolute subjectivity of its delir-
ium, it surprised the absurd and objective image of that
delirium in the identical madman. Truth insinuated itself, as
if by surprise (and not by violence, in the eighteenth-cen-
tury mode), in this play of reciprocal observations where it
never saw anything'but itself. But the asylum, in this com-
munity of madmen, placed the mirrors in such a way that

(264)

  
 “Stultifera Navis”

the melancholy of the English was easily explained by the
influence of a maritime climate, cold, humidity, the insta-
bility of the weather; all those fine droplets of water chat
penetrated the channels and fibers of the human body and
made ic lose its firmness, predisposed it to madness. Finally,
neglecting an immense literature that stretches from Ophe-
lia to the Lorelei, let us note only the great half-anthropo-
logical, half-cosmological analyses of Heinroth, which in-
terpret madness as the manifestation in man of an obscure
and aquatic element, a dark disorder, a moving chaos, the
seed and death of all things, which opposes the mind’s lu-
minous and adult stability.

But if the navigation of madmen is linked in the Western
mind with so many immemorial motifs, why, so abruptly,
in the fifteenth century, is the theme suddenly formulated
in literature and iconography? Why does the figure of the
Ship of Fools and its insane crew all at once invade the
most familiar landscapes? Why, from the old union of
warer and madness, was this ship born one day, and on just
that day?

Because it symbolized a great disquiet, suddenly dawning
on the horizon of European culture at the end of the
Middle Ages, Madness and the madman become major
figures, in their ambiguity: menace and mockery, the dizzy-
ing unreason of the world, and the feeble ridicule of men.

First a whole literature of tales and moral fables, in
origin, doubtless, quite remote. But by the end of the
Middle Ages, it bulks large: a long series of “follies” which,
stigmatizing vices and faults as in the past, no longer at-
tribute them all to pride, to lack of charity, to neglect of
Christian virtues, but to a sort of great unreason for which
nothing, in fact, is exactly responsible, buc which involves
everyone in a kind of secret complicity, The denunciation
of madness (/a folie) becomes the general form of criticism.

(73)

 
  

The Birth of the Asylum

the madman, when all was said and done, inevitably sur-
prised himself, despite himself, as @ madman. Freed from
the chains that made it a purely observed object, madness
lost, paradoxically, the essence of its liberty, which was
solitary exaltation; it became responsible for what it knew
of its truth; it imprisoned itself in an infinitely self-referring
observation; it was finally chained to the humiliation of
being its own object. Awareness was now linked to the
shame of being identical to that other, of being compro-
mised in him, and of already despising oneself before being
able to recognize or to know oneself.

3. Perpetual Judgment. By this play of mirrors, as by si-
lence, madness is ceaselessly called upon to judge itself. But
beyond this, it is at every moment judged from without;
judged not by moral or scientific conscience, but by a sort
of invisible tribunal in permanent session. ‘The asylum Pinel
dreamed of and partly realized at Bicétre, but especially at
La Salpétriére, is a juridical microcosm. To be efficacious,
this judgment must be redoubtable in aspect; all the icono-
gtaphic apanage of the judge and the executioner must be
present in the mind of the madman, so that he understands
what universe of judgment he now belongs to. The decor
of justice, in all its terror and implacability, will thus be
part of the treatment. One of the inmates at Bicétre
suffered from a religious delirium animated by a fear of
hell; he believed that the only way he could escape eternal
damnation was by rigorous abstinence. It was necessary to
compensate this fear of a remote justice by the presence of
2 more immediate and still more redoubtable one: “Could
the irresistible curse of his sinister ideas be counterbalanced
other than by the impression of a strong and deep fear?”
One evening, the director came to the patient's door “with
matter likely to produce fear--an angry eye, a thundering
tone of voice, a group of the staff armed with strong
chains that they shook noisily. They set some soup beside

(265)

 
  

MADNESS & CIVILIZATION

the madman and gave him precise orders to eat it during
the night, or else suffer the most cruel treatment. They
retired, and left the madman in the most distressed state of
indecision between the punishment with which he was
threatened and the frightening prospect of the torments in
the life to come. After an inner combat of several hours,
the former idea prevailed, and he decided to take some
nourishment,”

The asylum as a juridical instance recognized no other. It
judged immediately, and without appeal. It possessed its own
instruments of punishment, and used them as it saw fit. The
old confinement had generally been practiced outside of
normal juridical forms, but it imitated the punishment of
criminals, using the same prisons, the same dungeons, the
same physical brutality. The justice that reigned in Pinel’s
asylum did not borrow its modes of repression from the
other justice, but invented its own. Or rather, it used the
therapeutic methods that had become known in the eigh-
teenth century, but used them as chastisements. And this is
not the least of the paradoxes of Pinel’s “philanthropic”
and “liberating” enterprise, this conversion of medicine
into justice, of therapeutics into repression. In the medicine
of the classical period, baths and showers were used as rem-
edies as a result of the physicians’ vagaries about the nature
of the nervous system: the intention was to refresh the
organism, to relax the desiccated fibers; it is true that they
also added, among the happy consequences of the cold
shower, the psychological effect of the unpleasant surprise
which interrupted the course of ideas and changed the na-
ture of sentiments; but we were still in the landscape of
medical speculation, With Pinel, the use of the shower be-
came frankly juridical; the shower was the habitual pun-
ishment of the ordinary police tribunal that sat perma-
nently at the asylum: “Considered as a means of repression,
it often suffices to subject to the general law of manual

(266)
 The Birth of the Asylum

labor a madman who is susceptible to it, in order to con-
quer an obstinate refusal to take nourishment, and to sub-
jugate insane persons carried away by a sort of turbulent
and reasoned humor.”

Everything was organized so that the madman would
recognize himself in a world of judgment that enveloped
him on all sides; he must know that he is watched, judged,
and condemned; from transgression to punishment, the
connection must be evident, as a guilt recognized by all:
“We profit from the circumstance of the bath, remind him
of the transgression, or of the omission of an important
duty, and with the aid of a faucet suddenly release a
shower of, cold water upen his head, which often discon-
certs the madman or drives out a predominant idea by a
strong and unexpected impression; if the idea persists, the
shower is repeated, but care is taken to avoid the hard tone
and the shocking terms that would cause rebellion; on the
contrary, the madman is made to understand that it is for
his sake and reluctantly that we resort to such violent
measures; sometimes we add a joke, taking care not to go
too far with it.”1° This almost arithmetical obviousness of
punishment, repeated as often as necessary, the recognition
of transgression by its repression—all this must end in the
internalization of the juridical instance, and the birth of
remorse in the inmate’s mind: it is only at this point that the
judges agree to stop the punishment, certain that it will
continue indefinitely in the inmate’s conscience. One ma-
niac had the habit of tearing her clothes and breaking any
object that came into her hands; she was given showers, she
was put into a straitjacket, she finally appeared “humiliated
and dismayed”; but fearing that this shame might be transi-
tory and this remorse too superficial, “‘the director, in order
to impress a feeling of terror upon her, spoke to her with
the most energetic firmness, but without anger, and an-
nounced to her that she would henceforth be treated with

(267)

 
  

MaAvNESS & CIVILIZATION

the greatest severity.” The desired result was not long in
coming: “Her repentance was announced by a torrent of
tears which she shed for almost two hours.” The cycle is
complete twice over: the transgression is punished and its
author recognizes her guilt.

There were, however, madmen who escaped from this
movement and resisted the moral synthesis it brought about.
These latter would be set apart in the heart of the asylum,
forming a new confined population, which could not even
relate to justice. When we speak of Pinel and his work of
liberation, we too often omit this second reclusion. We
have already seen that he denied the benefits of asylum
reform to “fanatics who believe themselves inspired and
seek to make converts, and who take a perfidious pleasure
in inciting the other madmen to disobedience on the pretext
that it is better to obey God than man.” But confinement
and the dungeon will be equally obligatory for “those who
cannot be subjected to the general law of work and who, in
malicious activity, enjoy tormenting the other inmates,
provoking and ceaselessly inciting them to subjects of dis-
cord,” and for women “who during their seizures have an
irresistible propensity to steal anything they can lay cheir
hands on.” Disobedience by religious fanaticism, resistance
to work, and theft, the three great transgressions against
bourgeois society, the three major offenses against its essen-
tial values, are not excusable, even by madness; they de-
serve imprisonment pure and simple, exclusion in the most
rigorous sense of the term, since they all manifest the same
resistance to the moral and social uniformity that forms the
raison d’étre of Pinel’s asylum.

Formerly, unreason was set outside of judgment, to be
delivered, arbitrarily, to the powers of reason, Now it is
judged, and not only upon entering the asylum, in order to
be recognized, classified, and made innocent forever; it is
caught, on the contrary, in a perpetual judgment, which

(268)
 The Birth of the Asylum

never ceases to pursue it and to apply sanctions, to proclaim
its transgressions, to require honorable amends, to exclude,
finally, those whose transgressions risk compromising the
social order, Madness escaped from the arbitrary only in
order to enter a kind of endless trial for which the asylum
furnished simultaneously police, magistrates, and torturers;
atrial whereby any transgression in life, by a virtue proper
to life in the asylum, becomes a social crime, observed,
condemned, and punished; a trial which has no outcome
but in a perpetual recommencement in the internalized
form of remorse. The madmen “delivered” by Pinel and,
after him, the madmen of modern confinement are under
arraignment; if they have the privilege of no longer being
associated or identified with convicts, they are condemned,
at every moment, to be subject to an accusation whose text
is never given, for it is their entire life in the asylum which
constitutes it. The asylum of the age of positivism, which it
is Pinel’s glory to have founded, is not a free realm of obser-
vation, diagnosis, and therapeutics; it is a juridical space
where one is accused, judged, and condemned, and from
which one is never released except by the version of this
trial in psychological depth—that is, by remorse. Madness
will be punished in the asylum, even if it is innocent outside
of it. For a long time to come, and until our own day at
least, it is imprisoned in a moral world.

To silence, to recognition in the mirror, to perpetual
judgment, we must add a fourth structure peculiar to the
world of the asylum as it was constituted at the end of the
eighteenth century: this is the apotheosis of the medical
personage. Of them all, it is doubtless the most important,
since it would authorize not only new contacts between
doctor and patient, but a new relation between insanity and
medical thought, and ultimately command the whole mod-
ern experience of madness. Hitherto, we find in the asy-

(269)

 
  

Manpness & CIVILIZATION

lums only the same structures of confinement, but dis-
placed and deformed. With the new status of the medical
personage, the deepest meaning of confinement is abol-
ished: mental disease, with the meanings we now give it, is
made possible.

The work of Tuke and of Pinel, whose spirit and values
are so different, meet in this transformation of the medical
personage. The physician, as we have seen, played no part
in the life of confinement. Now he becomes the essential
figure of the asylum. He is in charge of entry. The ruling
at the Retreat is precise: “On the admission of patients, the
committee should, in general, require a certificate signed by
a medical person, . . . It should also be stated whether the
patient is afflicted with any complaint independent of in-
sanity. It is also desirable that some account should be sent,
how long the patient has been disordered; whether any, or
what sort of medical means have been used.”!7 From the
end of the eighteenth century, the medical certificate be-
comes almost obligatory for the confinement of madmen.
Bur within the asylum itself, the doctor takes a preponder-
ant place, insofar as he converts it into a medical space.
However, and this is the essential point, the doctor's inter-
vention is not made by virtue of a medical skill or power
that he possesses in himself and that would be justified by a
body of objective knowledge. Ir is not as a scientist that
homo medicus has authority in the asylum, but as a wise
man. If the medical profession is required, it is as a juridical
and moral guarantee, not in the name of science. A man of
great probity, of utter virtue and scruple, who had had long
experience in the asylum would do as well. For the medical
enterprise is only a part of an enormous moral task that
must be accomplished at the asylum, and which alone can
ensure the cure of the insane: “Must it not be an inviolable
law in the administration of any establishment for the in-
sane, whether public or private, to grant the maniac all the

(270)

 
  

The Birth of the Asylum

liberty that the safety of his person and of that of others
permits, and to proportion his repression to the greater or
lesser seriousness of danger of his deviations ..., to
gather all the facts that can serve to enlighten the physician
in treatment, to study with care the particular varieties of
behavior and temperament, and accordingly to use gentle-
ness or firmness, conciliatory terms or the tone of authority
and an inflexible severity?’"* According to Samuel Tuke,
the first doctor appointed at the Retreat was recommended
by his “indefatigable perseverance”; doubtless he had no
particular knowledge of mental illnesses when he entered
the asylum, but “he entered on his office with the anxiety
and ardor of a feeling mind, upon the exertion of whose
skill, depended the dearest interest of many of his fellow-
creatures.” He tried the various remedies that his own com-
mon sense and the experience of his predecessors suggested.
But he was soon disappointed, not because the results were
bad, or that the number of cures was minimal: “Yet the
medical means were so imperfectly connected with the
progress of recovery, that he could not avoid suspect-
ing them, to be rather concomitants than causes.” He
then realized that there was little to be done using the med-
ical methods known up to that time. The concern for hu-
manity prevailed within him, and he decided to use no
medicament that would be too disagreeable to the patient.
But it must not be thought that the doctor’s role had little
importance at the Retreat: by the visits he paid regularly to
the patients, by the authority he exercised in the house over
all the staff, “the physician . . . sometimes possesses more
influence over the patients’ minds, than the other atten-
dants,”

It is thought that Tuke and Pinel opened the asylum to
medical knowledge. They did not introduce science, but a
personality, whose powers borrowed from science only
their disguise, or at most their justification. These powers,

(2714)

 
  

Mavness & CIVILIZATION

by their nature, were of a moral and social order; they took
root in the madman’s minority status, in the insanity of his
person, not of his mind. If the medical personage could
isolate madness, it was not because lie knew it, but because
he mastered it; and what for positivism would be an image of
objectivity was only the other side of this domination. “It is a
very important object to win the confidence of these suffer-
ers, and to arouse in them feelings of respect and obedience,
which can only be the fruit of superior discernment, distin-
guished education, and dignity of tone and manner. Stupid-
ity, ignorance, and the lack of principles, sustained by a
tyrannical harshness, may incite fear, but always inspire dis-
trust. The keeper of madmen who has obtained domination
over them directs and rules their conduct as he pleases; he
must be endowed with a firm character, and on occasion
display an imposing strength. He must threaten little but
carry out his threats, and if he is disobeyed, punishment
must immediately ensue.”*® The physician could exercise
his absolute authority in the world of the asylum only inso-
far as, from the beginning, he was Father and Judge,
Family and Law—his medical practice being for a long time
no more than a complement to the old rites of Order,
Authority, and Punishment. And Pinel was well aware that
the doctor cures when, exclusive of modern therapeutics,
he brings into play these immemorial figures.

Pinel cites the case of a girl of seventeen who had been
raised by her parents with “extreme indulgence”; she had
fallen into a “giddy, mad delirium without any cause that
could be determined”, at the hospital she was treated with
great gentleness, but she always showed a certain “haughu-
ness” which could not be tolerated at the asylum; she spoke
“of her parents with nothing but bitterness.” It was decided
to subject her to a regime of strict authority; “the keeper,
in order to tame this inflexible character, seized the moment
of the bath and expressed himself forcibly concerning cer-

(272)
  

The Birth of the Asylum

tain unnatural persons who dared oppose their parents and
disdain their authority. He warned the girl she would
henceforth be treated with all the severity she deserved, for
she herself was opposed to her cure and dissimulated with
insurmountable obstinacy the basic cause of her illness.”
Through this new rigor and these threats, the sick girl felc
“profoundly moved . . . she ended by acknowledging her
wrongs and making a frank confession that she had
suffered a loss of reason as the result of a forbidden roman-
tic attachment, naming the person who had been its ob-
ject.” After this first confession, the cure became easy: “a
most favorable alteration occurred .. . she was hence-~
forth soothed and could not sufficiently express her grati-
tude toward the keeper who had brought an end to her
continual agitation, and had restored tranquillity and calm
to her heart.” There is not a moment of the story that
could not be transcribed in psychoanalytical terms. To such
a degree was it true that the medical personage, according
to Pinel, had to act not as the result of an objective defini-
tion of the disease or a specific classifying diagnosis, but by
relying upon that prestige which envelops the secrets of the
Family, of Authority, of Punishment, and of Love; it is by
bringing such powers into play, by wearing the mask of
Father and of Judge, that the physician, by one of those
abrupt short cuts that leave aside mere medical competence,
became the -almost magic perpetrator of the cure, and as-
sumed the aspect of a Thaumaturge; it was enough that he
observed and spoke, to cause secret faults to appear, insane
presumptions to vanish, and madness at last to yield to
reason. His presence and his words were gifted with that
power of disalienation, which at one blow revealed the
transgression and restored the order of morality.

It is a curious paradox to see medical practice enter the
uncertain domain of the quasi-miraculous at the very mo-
ment when the knowledge of mental illness tries to assume

(273)

 
  

Mavness & CIVILIZATION

a positive meaning. On the one hand, madness puts itself at
a distance in an objective field where the threats of unreason
disappear; but at this same moment, the madman tends to
form with the doctor, in an unbroken unity, 2 “couple”
whose complicity dates back to very old links. Life in the
asylum as Tuke and Pinel constituted it permitted the birth
of that delicate structure which would become the essential
nucleus of madness—a structure that formed a kind of
microcosm in which were symbolized the massive struc-
tures of bourgeois society and its values: Family-Child rela-
tions, centered on the theme of paternal authority; Trans-
gression-Punishment relations, centered on the theme of
immediate justice; Madness-Disorder relations, centered on
the theme of social and moral order. It is from these that the
physician derives his power to cure; and it is to the degree
that the patient finds himself, by so many old links, already
alienated in the doctor, within the doctor-patient couple,
that the doctor has the almost miraculous power to cure
him.

In the time of Pinel and Tuke, this power had nothing
extraordinary about it, it was explained and demonstrated
in the efficacity, simply, of moral behavior; it was no more
mysterious than the power of the eighteenth-century doc-
tor when he diluted fluids or relaxed fibers. But very soon
the meaning of this moral practice escaped the physician, to
the very extent that he enclosed his knowledge in the
norms of positivism: from the beginning of the nineteenth
century, the psychiatrist no longer quite knew what was
the nature of the power he had inherited from the great
reformers, and whose efficacity seemed so foreign to his
idea of mental illness and to the practice of all other doc-
tors,

This psychiatric practice, mysterious even to those who
used it, is very important in the situation of the madman
within the medical world. First because medicine of the

(274)
  

Mavwness & CivILIZATION

In farces and soties, the character of the Madman, the Fool,
or the Simpleton assumes more and more importance. He is
no longer simply a ridiculous and familiar silhouette in the
wings: he stands center stage as the guardian of truth—
playing here a role which is the complement and converse
of that taken by madness in the tales and the satires. If folly
Jeads each man into a blindness where he is lost, the mad-
man, on the contrary, reminds each man of his truth; in a
comedy where each man deceives the other and dupes him-
self, the madman is comedy to the second degree: the de-
ception of deception; he utters, in his simpleton’s language
which makes no show of reason, the words of reason that
release, in the comic, the comedy: he speaks love to lovers,
the truth of life to the young, the middling reality of things
to the proud, to the insolent, and to liars, Even the old
feasts of fools, so popular in Flanders and northern Europe,
were theatrical events, and organized into social and moral
criticism, whatever they may have contained of spontane-
ous religious parody.

In learned literature, too, Madness or Folly was at work,
at the very heart of reason and truth. It is Folly which
embarks all men without distinction on its insane ship and
binds them to the vocation of a common odyssey (Van
Oestvoren’s Blauwe Schute, Brant’s Narrenschiff); ic is
Folly whose baleful reign Thomas Murner conjures up in
his Narrenbeschwérung; it is Folly which gets the best of
Love in Corroz’s satire Contre fol amour, or argues with
Love as to which of the two comes first, which of the two
makes the other possible, and triumphs in Louise Labé’s
dialogue, Débat de folie et d’amour. Folly also has its aca-
demic pastimes; it is the object of argument, ic contends
against itself; it is denounced, and defends itself by claiming
that it is closer to happiness and truth than reason, chat it is
closer to reason than reason itself; Jakob Wimpfeling edits
the Monopolium philosopborum, and Judocus Gallus the

mind for the first time in the history of Western science
was to assume almost complete autonomy: from the time of
the Greeks, it had been no more than a chapter of medi-
cine, and we have seen Willis study madness under the
rubric “diseases of the head”; after Pinel and Tuke, psychi-
atry would become a medicine of a particular style: those
most eager to discover the origin of madness in organic
causes or in hereditary dispositions would not be able to
avoid this style. They would be all the more unable to
avoid it in that this particular style—bringing into play
increasingly obscure moral powers—would originally be a
sort of bad conscience; they would increasingly confine
themselves in positivism, the more they felt their practice
slipping out of it.

As positivism imposes itself upon medicine and psychi-
atry, this practice becomes more and more obscure, the
psychiatrist’s power more and more miraculous, and the
doctor-patient couple sinks deeper into a strange world. In
the patient’s eyes, the doctor becomes a thaumaturge; the
authority he has borrowed from order, morality, and the
family now seems to derive from himself; it is because he is
a doctor that he is believed to possess these powers, and
while Pinel, with Tuke, strongly asserted that his moral
action was not necessarily linked to any scientific compe-
tence, it was thought, and by the patience first of all, that it
was in the esotericism of his knowledge, in some almost
daemonic secret of knowledge, that the doctor had found
the power to unravel insanity; and increasingly the patient
would accept this self-surrender to a doctor both divine
and satanic, beyond human measure in any case; increas-
ingly he would alienate himself in the physician, accepting
entirely and in advance all his prestige, submitting from
the very first to a will he experienced as magic, and to a
science he regarded as prescience.and divination, thus be-
coming the ideal and perfect correlative of those powers he

(275)

 
  

MavNESS & CIVILIZATION

projected upon the doctor, pure object without any resist-
ance except his own inertia, quite ready to become precisely
that hysteric in whom Charcot exalted the doctor’s marvel-
ous powers. If we wanted to analyze the profound structures
of objectivity in the knowledge and practice of nineteenth-
century psychiatry from Pinel to Freud,” we should have
to show in fact that such objectivity was from the start a
reification of a magical nature, which could only be ac-
complished with the complicity of the patient himself, and
beginning from a transparent and clear moral practice,
gradually forgotten as positivism imposed its myths of sci-
entific objectivity; a practice forgotten in its origins and its
meaning, but always used and always present. What we
call psychiatric practice is a certain moral tactic contempo-
rary with the end of the eighteenth century, preserved in
the rites of asylum life, and overlaid by the myths of posi-
tivism.

But if the doctor soon became a thaumaturge for the
patient, he could not be one in his own positivist doctor's
eyes. That obscure power whose origin he no longer knew,
in which he could not decipher che patient’s complicity,
and in which he would not consent to acknowledge the
ancient powers which constituted it, nevertheless had to be
given some status; and since nothing in positivist under-
standing could justify such a transfer of will or similar re-
mote-control operations, the moment would soon come
when madness itself would be held responsible for such
anomalies. These cures without basis, which must be rec-
ognized as not being false cures, would soon become the
true cures of false illnesses. Madness was not what one be-
lieved, nor what it believed itself to be; it was infinitely less
than itself: a combination of persuasion and mystification.
We can see here the genesis of Babinski’s pithiatism. And
by a strange reversal, thought leaped back almost two cen-
turies to the era when between madness, false madness, and

(276)
 The Birth of the Asylum

the simulation of madness, the limit was indistinct—identi-
cal symptoms confused to the point where transgression
replaced unity; further still, medical thought finally
effected an identification over which all Western thought
since Greek medicine had hesitated: the identification of
madness with madness—that is, of the medical concept
with the critical concept of madness. At the end of the
nineteenth century, and in the thought of Babinski’s con-
temporaries, we find that prodigious postulate, which no
medicine had yet dared formulate: that madness, after all,
was only madness,

Thus while the victim of mental illness is entirely alien-
ated in the real person of his doctor, the doctor dissipates
the reality of the mental illness in the critical concept of
madness. So that there remains, beyond the empty forms of
positivist thought, only a single concrete reality: the doctor-
patient couple in which all alienations are summarized,
linked, and loosened. And it is to this degree that all nine-
teenth-century psychiatry really converges on Freud, the
first man to accept in all its seriousness the reality of the
physician-patient couple, the first to consent not to look
away nor to investigate elsewhere, the first not to attempt
to hide it in a psychiatric theory that more or less harmon-
ized with the rest of medical knowledge; the first to follow
its consequences with absolute rigor. Freud demystified alk
the other asylum structures: he abolished silence and ob-
servation, he eliminated madness’s recognition of itself in
the mirror of its own spectacle, he silenced the instances of
condemnation. But on the other hand he exploited the
structure that enveloped the medical personage; he ampli-
fied its thaumaturgical virtues, preparing for its omnipo-
tence a quasi-divine status. He focussed upon this single
presence-~-concealed behind the patient and above him, in
an absence that is also a total presence—all the powers that
had been distributed in the collective existence of the asy-

(277)

 
  

Manvness & CIVILIZATION

lum; he transformed this into an absolute Observation, a
pure and circumspect Silence, a Judge who punishes and
rewards in a judgment that does not even condescend to
language; he made it the Mirror in which madness, in an
almost motionless movement, clings to and casts off itself.

To the doctor, Freud transferred all the structures Pinel
and Tuke had set up within confinement. He did deliver
the patient from the existence of the asylum within which
his “liberators” had alienated him; but he did not deliver
him from what was essential in this existence; he regrouped
its powers, extended them to the maximum by uniting them
in the doctor’s hands; he created the psychoanalytical situa-
tion where, by an inspired short-circuit, alienation becomes
disalienating because, in the doctor, it becomes a subject.

The doctor, as an alienating figure, remains the key to
psychoanalysis. It is perhaps because it did not suppress this
ultimate structure, and because it referred all the others to
it, that psychoanalysis has not been able, will not be able, to
hear the voices of unreason, nor to decipher in themselves
the signs of the madman. Psychoanalysis can unravel some
of the forms of madness; it remains a stranger to the sover-
eign enterprise of unreason. It can neither liberate nor
transcribe, nor most certainly explain, what is essential in
this enterprise.

Since the end of the eighteenth century, the life of un-
reason no longer manifests itself except in the lightning-
flash of works such as those of Hélderlin, of Nerval, of
Nietzsche, or of Artaud—forever irreducible to those
alienations that can be cured, resisting by their own
strength that gigantic moral imprisonment which we are in,
the habit of calling, doubtless by antiphrasis, the liberation
of the insane by Pinel and Tuke.

CONCLUSION

Tue Goya who painted The Madhouse must have experi-
enced before that grovel of flesh in the void, that nakedness
among bare walls, something related to a contemporary
pathos: the symbolic tinsel that crowned the insane kings
left in full view suppliane bodies, bodies vulnerable to
chains and whips, which contradicted the delirium of the
faces, less by the poverty of these trappings than by the
human truth which radiated from all that unprofaned flesh.
The man in the tricorne is not mad because he has stuck an
old hat upon his nakedness; but within this madman in a hat
rises—by the inarticulate power of his muscular body, of
his savage and marvelously unconstricted youth—a human
presence already liberated and somehow free since the be-
ginning of time, by his birthright. The Madhouse is less
concerned with madness and those strange faces one finds
elsewhere in the Caprichos, moreover, than with the vast
monotony of these new bodies, shown in all their vigor,
and whose gestures, if they invoke their dreams, celebrate
especially their dark freedom: its language is close to the
world of Pinel.

(279)

 
  

Manpness & CIVILIZATION

The Goya of the Disparates and the Quinta del Sordo
addresses himself to another madness. Not that of madmen
cast into prison, but that of man cast into darkness. Does
Goya not link us, by memory, with the old world of en-
chantments, of fantastic rides, of witches perched on the
branches of dead trees? Is not the monster whispering its
secrets into the ears of the Monk related to the gnome who
fascinated Bosch’s Saint Anthony? But they are different
for Goya, and their prestige, which overshadows all his
later work, derives from another power. For Bosch or
Brueghel, these forms are generated by the world itself;
through the fissures of a strange poetry, they rise from
stones and plants, they well out of an animal howl; the
whole complicity of nature is not too much for their dance.
Goya’s forms are born out of nothing: they have no back-
ground, in the double sense that they are silhouetted against
only the most monotonous darkness, and that nothing can
assign them their origin, their limit, and their nature. The
Disparates are without landscape, without walls, without
setting—and this is still a further difference from the
Caprichos; there is not a star in the night sky of the great
human bats we see in the Way of Flying. The branch on
which these witches jabber—out of what tree does it grow?
Does it fly? Toward what sabbath, and what clearing?
Nothing in all this deals with a world, neither this one
nor any other. It is indeed a question of that Sleep of
Reason which Goya, in 1797, had already made the first
image of the “universal idiom”; it is a question of a night
which is doubtless that of classical unreason, that triple
night into which Orestes sank. But in that night, man
communicates with what is deepest in himself, and with
what is most solitary. The desert of Bosch’s Saint Anthony
was infinitely populous; and even if it was a product of her
imagination, the landscape that Dulle Griet moved through
was marked by a whole human language. Goya’s Monk,

(280)
 Conclusion

with that hot beast against his back, its paws on his shoul~
ders and its mouth panting at his ear, remains alone: no
secret is revealed. All that is present is the most internal,
and at the same time the most savagely free, of forces: the
power which hacks apart the bodies in the Gran Disparate,
which breaks free and assaults our eyes in the Raging Mad-
ness. Beyond that point, the faces themselves decompose;
this is no longer the madness of the Caprichos, which tied
on masks truer than the truth of faces; this is a madness
beneath the mask, a madness that eats away faces, corrodes
features; there are no longer eyes or mouths, but glances
shot from nowhere and staring at nothing (as in the
Witches’ Sabbath); or screams from black holes (as in the
Pilgrimage of Saint Isidore). Madness has become man’s
possibility of abolishing both man and the world—and even
_those images that challenge the world and deform man. It
is, far beyond dreams, beyond the nightmare of bestiality,
the last recourse: the end and the beginning of everything.
Not because it is a promise, as in German lyricism, but
because it is the ambiguity of chaos and apocalypse: Goya’s
Idiot who shrieks and twists his shoulder to escape from the
nothingness that imprisons him—is this the birth of the first
man and his first movement toward liberty, or the last con-
vulsion of the last dying man?

And this madness that links and divides time, that twists
the world into the ring of a single night, this madness so
foreign to the experience of its contemporaries, does it not
transmit~to those able to receive it, to Nietzsche and to
Artaud—those barely audible voices of classical unreason,
in which it was always a question of nothingness and night,
but amplifying them now to shrieks and frenzy? But giving
them for the first time an expression, a droit de cité, and a
hold on Western culture which makes possible all contesta-
tions, as well as total contestation? But restoring their prim-
itive savagery?

(287)

 
  

Manpwess & CIVILIZATION

Sade’s calm, patient language also gathers up the final
words of unreason and also gives them, for the future, a
remoter meaning. Between Goya’s broken drawings and
that uninterrupted stream of words continuing from the
first volume of Justine to the tenth of Juliette, there is
doubtless nothing in common except a certain movement
that retraces the course of contemporary lyricism, drying
up its sources, rediscovering the secret of unreason’s noth-
ingness.

Within the chateau where Sade’s hero confines himself,
within the convents, the forests, the dungeons where he
endlessly pursues the agony of his victims, it seems at first
glance thar nature can act with utter freedom. There man
rediscovers a truth he had forgotten, though it was mani-
fest: what desire can be contrary to nature, since it was
given to man by nature itself? And since it was taught by
nature in the great lesson of life and death which never stops
repeating itself in the world? The madness of desire, insane
murders, the most unreasonable passions—all are wisdom
and reason, since they are a part of the order of nature.
Everything that morality and religion, everything that a
clumsy society has stifled in man, revives in the castle of
murders, There man is finally attuned to his own nature; or
rather, by an ethic peculiar to this strange confinement,
man must scrupulously maintain, withour deviation, his
fidelity to nature: a strict task, a total enterprise: “You will
know nothing unless you have known everything; if you
are timid enough to stop with Nature, she will escape you
forever.”* Conversely, if man has wounded or changed na-
ture, it is man’s task to repair the damage through the
mathematics of a sovereign vengeance; “Nature caused us
all to be born equal; if fate is pleased to disturb this plan of
the general law, it is our responsibility to correct its ca-
price, and to repair by our attention the usurpations of the
stronger.”? The slowness of revenge, like the insolence of

(282)
 Conclusion

desire, belongs to nature. There is nothing that the madness
of men invents which is not either nature made manifest or
nature restored,

But this is only the first phase of Sade’s thought: the
ironic justification, both rational and lyrical, the gigantic
pastiche, of Rousseau. Beyond this demonstration-by-ab-
surdity of the inanity of contemporary philosophy, beyond
all its verbiage about man and nature, the real decisions are
still to be made: decisions that are also breaks, in which the
links between man and his natural being disappear.* The
famous Society of the Friends of Crime, the project of a
Swedish Constitution, once we remove their stinging refer-
ences to the Social Contract and to the proposed constitu-
tions for Poland or Corsica, establish nothing but the sov-
ereign rigor of subjectivity in the rejection of all natural
liberty and all natural equality: uncontrolled disposal of
one member by the other, the unconditional exercise of
violence, the limitless application of the right of death—this
entire society, whose only link is the very rejection of a
link, appears to be a dismissal of nature—the only cohesion
asked of individuals is intended to protect, not a natural
existence, but the free exercise of sovereignty over and
against nature.* The relation established by Rousseau is
precisely reversed; sovereignty no longer transposes the
natural existence; the latter is only an object for the sover-
eign, which permits him to measure his total liberty. Fol-
lowed to its logical conclusion, desire leads only in ap;
ance to the rediscovery of nature. Actually, for Sade there
is no return to the natal terrain, no hope that the first re-
jection of social order may surreptitiously become the re-
established order of happiness, through a dialectic of nature
renouncing and thus confirming itself. The solitary mad-
ness of desire that still for Hegel, as for the eighteenth-
century philosophers, plunges man into a natural world that
is immediately resumed in a social world, for Sade merely

(283)

 
  

Manvness & CIVILIZATION

casts man into a void that dominates nature in a total ab-
sence of proportion and community, into the endlessly re-
peated nonexistence of gratification. The night of madness
is thus limitless; what might have been supposed to be
man’s violent nature was only the infinity of non-nature.
Here is the source of Sade’s great monotony: as he ad-
vances, the settings dissolve; the surprises, the incidents, the
pathetic or dramatic links of the scenes vanish. What was
still vicissitude in Justine—an event experienced, hence
new—becomes in Juliette a sovereign game, always trium-
phant, without negativity, and whose perfection is such
that its novelty can only be its similarity to itself. As with
Goya, there are no longer any backgrounds for these metic-
ulous Disparates. And yet in this absence of decor, which
can as easily be total night as absolute day (there are no
shadows in Sade), we advance slowly toward a goal: the
death of Justine. Her innocence had exhausted even the
desire to torment it. We cannot say that crime had not
overcome her virtue; we must say inversely that her natural
virtue had brought her to the point of having exhausted all
the possible means of being an object for crime. And at this
point, when crime can do nothing more than drive her
from the domain of its sovereignty (Juliette expels her
from the Chateau de Noirceuil), Nature in her turn, so
long dominated, scorned, profaned,’ submits entirely to
that which contradicted her: Nature in turn enters madness,
and there, in an instant, but for an instant only, restores her
omnipotence. The storm that is unleashed, the lightning
that strikes and consumes Justine, is Nature become crim-
inal subjectivity. This death that seems to escape from the
insane domain of Juliette belongs to Nature more pro-
foundly than any other; the night of storm, of thunder and
lightning, is a sufficient sign that Nature is lacerating herself,
that she has reached the extreme point of her dissension,
and that she is revealing in this golden flash a sovereignty

 “Stultifera Navis”

Monopolium et societas, vulgo des lichtschiffs. Finally, at
the center of all these serious games, the great humanist
texts: the Moria rediviva of Flayder and Erasmus’s Praise
of Folly. And confronting all these discussions, with their
tireless dialectic, confronting these discourses constantly
reworded and reworked, a long dynasty of images, from
Hieronymus Bosch with The Cure of Madness and The
Ship of Fools, down to Brueghel and his Dulle Griet;
woodcuts and engravings transcribe what the theater, what
literature and art have already taken up: the intermingled
themes of the Feast and of the Dance of Fools. Indeed,
from the fifteenth century on, the face of madness has
haunted the imagination of Western man.

A sequence of dates speaks for itself: the Dance of
Death in the Cimetiére des Innocents doubtless dates from
the first years of the fifteenth century, the one in the
Chaise-Dieu was probably composed around 1460; and it
was in 1485 that Guyot Marchant published his Danse
macabre, These sixty years, certainly, were dominated by
all this grinning imagery of Death. And it was in 1494 that
Brant wrote the Narrenschiff; in 1497 it was translated into
Latin. In the very last years of the century Hieronymus
Bosch painted his Ship of Fools. The Praise of Folly dates
from 1509. The order of succession is clear.

Up to the second half of the fifteenth century, or even a
little beyond, the theme of death reigns alone. The end of
man, the end of time bear the face of pestilence and war.
What overhangs human existence is this conclusion and this
order from which nothing escapes. The presence that
threatens even within this world is a fleshless one. Then in
the last years of the century this enormous uneasiness turns
on itself; the mockery of madness replaces death and its
solemnity. From the discovery of that necessity which in-
evitably reduces man to nothing, we have shifted to the
scornful contemplation of that nothing which is existence

(75)
  

Conclusion

which is both herself and something quite outside herself:
the sovereignty of a mad heart that has attained, in its soli-
tude, the limits of the world that wounds it, that turns it
against itself and abolishes it at the moment when to have
mastered it so well gives it the right to identify itself with
that world. That lighming-flash which Nature drew from
herself in order to strike Justine was identical with the long
existence of Juliette, who would also disappear in solirude,
leaving no trace or corpse or anything upon which Nature
could claim her due. The nothingness of unreason, in
which the language of Nature had died forever, has be-
come a violence of Nature and against Nature, to the point
of the savage abolition of itself.°

For Sade as for Goya, unreason continues to watch by
night; but in this vigil it joins with fresh powers. The non-
being it once was now becomes the power to annihilate.
Through Sade and Goya, the Western world received the
possibility of transcending its reason in violence, and of
recovering tragic experience beyond the promises of dialec-
tc.

After Sade and Goya, and since them, unreason has be-
longed to whatever is decisive, for the modern world, in
any work of art: that is, whatever any work of art contains
that is both murderous and constraining,

The madness of Tasso, the melancholia of Swift, the de-
lrium of Rousseau belong to their works, just as these
works belong to their authors, Here in the texts, there in
the lives of the men, the same violence spoke, or the same
bitterness; visions certainly were exchanged; language and
delirium interlaced. But further, the work of art and mad-
ness, in classical experience, were more profoundly united at
another level: paradoxically, at the point where they lim-
ited one another. For there existed a region where madness
challenged the work of art, reduced it ironically, made of

(285)

 
  

Maoness & CIVILIZATION

its iconographic landscape a pathological world of hallu-
cinations; thar language which was delirium was not a
work of art. And conversely, delirium was robbed of its
meager truth as madness if it was called a work of art. But
by admitting this very fact, there was no reduction of one
by the other, bur rather (remembering Montaigne) a dis-
covery of the central incertitude where the work of art is
born, at the moment when it stops being born and is truly a
work of art. In this opposition, to which Tasso and Swift
bore witness after Lucretius—and which it was vain to at-
tempt to separate into lucid intervals and crises—was dis-
closed a distance where the very truth of a work of art
raised a problem: was it madness, or a work of art? Inspira-
tion, or hallucination? A spontaneous babble of words, or
the pure origins of language? Must its truth, even before its
birth, be taken from the wretched truth of men, or discov-
ered far beyond its origin, in the being that it presumes?
The madness of the writer was, for other men, the chance
to see being born, over and over again, in the discourage-
ment of repetition and disease, the truth of the work of
art.
The madness of Nietzsche, the madness of Van Gogh or
of Artaud, belongs to their work perhaps neither more nor
less profoundly, but in quite another way. The frequency
in the modern world of works of art that explode out of
madness no doubt proves nothing about the reason of that
world, about the meaning of such works, or even about the
relations formed and broken between the real world and
the artists who produced such works. And yer this fre-
quency must be taken seriously, as if it were the insistence
of a question: from the time of Hélderlin and Nerval, the
number of writers, painters, and musicians who have “suc-
cumbed” to madness has increased; but let us make no mis-
take here; between madness and the work of art, there has
been no accommodation, no more constant exchange, no

(286)
 Conclusion

communication of languages; their opposition is much
more dangerous than formerly; and their competition now
allows no quarter; theirs is a game of life and death. Ar-
taud’s madness does not slip through the fissures of the
work of art; his madness is precisely the absence of the
work of art, the reiterated presence of that absence, its
central void experienced and measured in all its endless di-
mensions. Nietzsche’s last cry, proclaiming himself both
Christ and Dionysos, is not on the border of reason and
unreason, in the perspective of the work of art, their com-
mon dream, finally realized and immediately vanishing, of a
reconciliation of the “shepherds of Arcady and the fisher-
men of Tiberias”; it is the very annihilation of the work of
art, the point where it becomes impossible and where it
must fall silent; the hammer has just fallen from the phi-
losopher’s hands. And Van Gogh, who did not want to ask
“permission from doctors to paint pictures,” knew quite
well chat his work and his madness were incompatible,
Madness is the absolute break with the work of art; it
forms the constitutive moment of abolition, which dissolves
in time the truth of the work of art; it draws the exterior
edge, the line of dissolution, the contour against the void.
Artaud’s oeuvre experiences its own absence in madness, but
that experience, the fresh courage of that ordeal, all those
words hurled against a fundamental absence of language,
all that space of physical suffering and terror which sur-
rounds or rather coincides with the void—that is the work
of art itself: the sheer cliff over the abyss of the work’s
absence. Madness is no longer the space of indecision
through which it was possible to glimpse the original truth
of the work of art, but the decision beyond which this
truth ceases irrevocably, and hangs forever over history, It
is of little importance on exactly which day in the autumn
of 1888 Nietzsche went mad for good, and after which his
texts no longer afford philosophy but psychiatry: all of

(287)

 
  

MaAvNESS & CIVILIZATION

them, including the postcard to Strindberg, belong to
Nietzsche, and all are related to The Birth of Tragedy. But
we must not think of this continuity in terms of a system,
of a thematics, or even of an existence: Nietzsche’s mad-
ness—that is, the dissolution of his thought—is that by
which his thought opens out onto the modern world. What
made it impossible makes it immediate for us; what took it
from Nietzsche offers it to us. This does not mean that
madness is the only language common to the work of art
and the modern world (dangers of the pathos of maledic-
tion, inverse and symmetrical danger of psychoanalyses) ;
but it means that, through madness, a work that seems to
drown in the world, to reveal there its non-sense, and to
transfigure itself with the features of pathology alone, actu-
ally engages within itself the world’s time, masters it, and
leads it; by the madness which interrupts it, a work of art
opens a void, a moment of silence, a question without an-
swer, provokes a breach without reconciliation where the
world is forced to question itself. What is necessarily a
profanation in the work of art returns to that point, and, in
the time of that work swamped in madness, the world is
made aware of its guilt. Henceforth, and through the me-
diation of madness, it is the world that becomes culpable
(for the first time in the Western world) in relation to the
work of art; it is now arraigned by the work of art, obliged
to order itself by its language, compelled by it to a task of
recognition, of reparation, to the task of restoring reason
from that unreason and to that unreason. The madness in
which the work of art is engulfed is the space of our enter-
prise, it is the endless path to fulfillment, it is our mixed vo-
cation of apostle and exegete, This is why it makes little
difference when the first voice of madness insinuated itself
into Nietzsche’s pride, into Van Gogh’s humility. There is
no madness except as the final instant of the work of art—
the work endlessly drives madness to its limits; where there

(288)
 Conclusion

is a work of art, there is no madness; and yet madness is
contemporary with the work of art, since it inaugurates
the time of its truch. The moment when, together, the work
of art and madness are born and fulfilled is the beginning
of the time when the world finds itself arraigned by that
work of art and responsible before it for what it is.

Ruse and new triumph of madness: the world that
thought to measure and justify madness through psychol-
ogy must justify itself before madness, since in its struggles
and agonies it measures itself by the excess of works like
those of Nietzsche, of Van Gogh, of Artaud. And nothing
in itself, especially not what it can know of madness, as-
sures the world that it is justified by such works of madness.

From a spiritual point of view, poverty at the end of the
sixteenth and the beginning of the seventeenth century was
experienced as an apocalyptic threat. “One of the most evi- ©
dent signs that the coming of the Son of God and the end
of time are at hand is the extreme of both spiricual and
temporal poverty to which the world is reduced. These
are evil days . . . afflictions have multiplied because of the
multitude of transgressions, pain being the inseparable
shadow of evil.” (Jean-Pierre Camus, De la mendicité

itself. Fear in the face of the absolute limit of death turns
inward in a continuous irony; man disarms it in advance,
making it an object of derision by giving it an everyday,
tamed form, by constantly renewing it in the spectacle of
life, by scattering it throughout the vices, the difficulties,
and the absurdities of all men. Death’s annihilation is no
longer anything because it was already everything, because
life itself was only futility, vain words, a squabble of cap
and bells. The head that will become a skull is already
empty. Madness is the déja-a of death.‘ But it is also its
vanquished presence, evaded in those everyday signs
which, announcing that death reigns already, indicate that
its prey will be a sorry prize indeed. What death unmasks
was never more than a mask; to discover the grin of the
skeleton, one need only lift off something that was neither
beauty nor truth, but only a plaster and tinsel face. From
the vain mask to the corpse, the same smile persists. But
when the madman laughs, he already laughs with the laugh
of death; the lunatic, anticipating the macabre, has dis-
armed it. The cries of Dulle Griet triumph, in the high
Renaissance, over that Triumph of Death sung at the end
of the Middle Ages on the walls of the Campo Santo.

The substitution of the theme of madness for that of
death does not mark a break, but rather a torsion within the
same anxiery. Whar is in question is still the nothingness of
existence, but this nothingness is no longer considered an
external, final term, both threat and conclusion; it is ex-
perienced from within as the continuous and constant form
of existence. And where once man’s madness had been not
to see that death’s term was approaching, so that it was
necessary to recall him to wisdom with the spectacle of -
death, now wisdom consisted of denouncing madness
everywhere, teaching men that they were no more than
dead men already, and that if the end was near, it was to
the degree that madness, become universal, would be one

In nineteenth-century evolutionism, madness is indeed a
return, but along a chronological path; it is not the ab-
solute collapse of time. It is a question of time turned back,
not of repetition in the strict sense. Psychoanalysis, which
has tried to confront madness and unreason again, has
found itself faced with this problem of time; fixation,
death-wish, collective unconscious, archetype define more
or less happily this heterogeneity of two temporal struc-
tures: that which is proper to the experience of Unreason
and to the knowledge it envelops; that which is proper to
the knowledge of madness, and to the science ic authorizes.

  ABOUT THE AUTHOR

Michel Foucault was born in Poitiers, France, in 1926. He
fectured in many universities throughout the world and
served as director at the Institut Frangais in Hamburg, and
the Insticut de Philosophie at the Faculté des Lettres in the
University of Clermont-Ferrand. He wrote frequently for
French newspapers and reviews, and held a chair at France's
most prestigious institution, the Collége de France.

In addition to Madness and Civilization, his works available
in Vintage are The Order of Things, The Birth of the Clinic,
Discipline and Punish, and The History of Sexuality.

Michel Foucault died in June 1984.

and the same with death itself. This is what Eustache Des-
champs prophesies:

We are cowardly and weak,
Covetous, old, evil-tongued.
Fools are all I see, in truth,
The end is near,
Allgoesill...

The elements are now reversed. It is no longer the end of
time and of the world which will show retrospectively that
men were mad not to have been prepared for them; it is the
tide of madness, its secret invasion, that shows that the
world is near its final catastrophe; it is man’s insanity that
invokes and makes necessary the world’s end.

In its various forms—plastic or literary—this experience
of madness seems extremely coherent. Painting and text
constantly refer to one another—commentary here and il-
lustration there. We find the same theme of the Narrentanz
over and over in popular festivals, in theatrical perform-
ances, in engravings and woodcuts, and the entire last part
of the Praise of Folly is constructed on the model of a long
dance of madmen in which each profession and each estate
parades in turn to form the great round of unreason. It is
likely that in Bosch’s Temptation of Saint Anthony in Lis-
bon, many figures of the fantastic fauna which invade the
canvas are borrowed from traditional masks; some perhaps
are transferred from the Malleus maleficarum. As for the
famous Ship of Fools, is it not a direct translation of
Brant’s Narrenschiff, whose title it bears, and of which it
seems to illustrate quite precisely canto XXVII, also con-
secrated to stigmatizing “drunkards and gluttons”? It has
even been suggested that Bosch’s painting was part of a
series of pictures illustrating the principal cantos of Brant’s
poem.

(27)

 
  

Mavness & CIVILIZATION

As a matter of fact, we must not be misled by what
appears to be a strict continuity in these themes, nor imag-
ine more than is revealed by history itself. It is unlikely that
an analysis like the one Emile Male worked out for the pre-
ceding epochs, especially apropos of the theme of death,
could be repeated. Between word and image, between what
is depicted by language and what is uttered by plastic form,
the unity begins to dissolve; a single and identical meaning
is not immediately common to them. And if it is true that
the image still has the function of speaking, of transmitting
something consubstantial with language, we must recognize
that it already no longer says the same thing; and that by its
own plastic values painting engages in an experiment that
will take it farther and farther from language, whatever the
superficial identity of the theme. Figure and speech still
illustrate the same fable of folly in the same moral world,
but already they take two different directions, indicating,
in a stil] barely perceptible scission, what will be the great
line of cleavage in the Western experience of madness.

The dawn of madness on the horizon of the Renaissance
is first perceptible in the decay of Gothic symbolism; as if
that world, whose network of spiritual meanings was so
close-knit, had begun to unravel, showing faces whose
meaning was no longer clear except in the forms of mad-
ness. The Gothic forms persist for a time, but little by little
they grow silent, cease to speak, to remind, to teach any-
thing but their own fantastic presence, transcending all
possible language (though still familiar to the eye). Freed
from wisdom and from the teaching that organized it, the
image begins to gravitate about its own madness.

Paradoxically, this liberation derives from a proliferation
of meaning, from a self-multiplication of significance,
weaving relationships so numerous, so intertwined, so rich,
that they can no longer be deciphered except in the esoter-
ism of knowledge. Things themselves become so burdened

(78)
  

“Stultifera Navis”

with attributes, signs, allusions that they finally lose their
own form. Meaning is no longer read in an immediate per-
ception, the figure no longer speaks for itself; between the
knowledge which animates it and the form into which it is
transposed, a gap widens. It is free for the dream. One book
bears witness to meaning’s proliferation at the end of the
Gothic world, the Speculum humanae salvationis, which,
beyond all the correspondences established by the patristic
tradition, elaborates, berween the Old and the New Testa-
ment, a symbolism not on the order of Prophecy, but deriv-
ing from an equivalence of imagery. The Passion of Christ
is not prefigured only by the sacrifice of Abraham; it is
surrounded by all the glories of torture and its innumerable
dreams; Tubal the blacksmith and Isaiah’s wheel take their
places around the Cross, forming beyond all the lessons of
the sacrifice the fantastic tableau of savagery, of tormented
bodies, and of suffering. Thus the image is burdened with
supplementary meanings, and forced to express them, And
dreams, madness, the unreasonable can also slip into this
excess of meaning. The symbolic figures easily become
nightmare silhouettes. Witness that old image of wisdom so
often translated, in German engravings, by a long-necked
bird whose thoughts, rising slowly from heart to head,
have time to be weighed and reflected on; a symbol whose
values are blunted by being overemphasized: the long path
of reflection becomes in the image the alembic of a subrle
learning, an instrument which distills quintessences. The
neck of the Gutemensch is endlessly elongated, the better
to illustrate, beyond wisdom, all the real mediations of
knowledge; and the symbolic man becomes a fantastic bird
whose disproportionate neck folds a thousand times upon
itself—an insane being, halfway between animal and thing,
closer to the charms of an image than to the rigor of a
meaning. This symbolic wisdom is a prisoner of the mad-
ness of dreams.

(t9)

 
  

MADNESS & CIVILIZATION

A fundamental conversion of the world of images: the
constraint of a multiplied meaning liberates that world
from the control of form. So many diverse meanings are
established beneath the surface of the image that it presents
only an enigmatic face. And its power is no longer to teach
but to fascinate. Characteristic is the evolution of the
famous gryllos already familiar to the Middle Ages in the
English psalters, and at Chartres and Bourges. It taught,
then, how the soul of desiring man had become a prisoner
of the beast; these grotesque faces set in the bellies of mon-
sters belonged to the world of the great Platonic metaphor
and denounced the spirit’s corruption in the folly of sin.
But in the fifteenth century the gryllos, image of human
madness, becomes one of the preferred figures in the count-
less Temptations. What assails the hermit’s tranquillity is
not objects of desire, but these hermetic, demented forms
which have risen from a dream, and remain silent and fur-
tive on the surface of a world. In the Lisbon Temptation,
facing Saint Anthony sits one of these figures born of mad-
ness, of its solitude, of its penitence, of its privations, a wan
smile lights this bodiless face, the pure presence of anxiety
in the form of an agile grimace. Now it is exactly this
nightmare silhouette that is at once the subject and object
of the temptation; it is this figure which fascinates the gaze
of the ascetic—both are prisoners of a kind of mirror inter-
rogation, which remains unanswered in a silence inhabited
only by the monstrous swarm that surrounds them, The
gryllos no longer recalls man, by its satiric form, to his
spiritual vocation forgotten in the folly of desire. It is mad-
ness become Temptation; all it embodies of the impossible,
the fantastic, the inhuman, all that suggests the unnatural,
the writhing of an insane presence on the earth’s surface—
ali this is precisely what gives the gryllos its strange power.
The freedom, however frightening, of his dreams, the hal-
lucinations of his madness, have more power of attraction

(20)
  

 

“Stultifera Nevis”

for fifteenth-century man than the desirable reality of the
flesh,

What then is this fascination which now operates
through the images of madness?

First, man finds in these fantastic figures one of the se-
crets and one of the vocations of his nature. In the thought
of the Middle Ages, the legions of animals, named once and
for all by Adam, symbolically bear the values of humanity.
But at the beginning of the Renaissance, the relations with
animality are reversed; the beast is set free; it escapes the
world of legend and moral illustration to acquire a fantastic
nature of its own. And by an astonishing reversal, it is now
the animal that will stalk man, capture him, and reveal him
to his own truth. Impossible animals, issuing from a de-
mented imagination, become the secret nature of man; and
when on the Last Day sinful man appears in his hideous
nakedness, we see that he has the monstrous shape of a
delirious animal; these are the screech owls whose toad
bodies combine, in Thierry Bouts’s Hell, with the nakedness
of the damned; these are Stephan Lochner’s winged insects
with cats’ heads, sphinxes with beetles’ wing cases, birds
whose wings are as disturbing and as avid as hands; this is
the great beast of prey with knotty fingers that figures in
Matthias Griinewald’s Temptation. Animality has escaped
domestication by human symbols and values; and it is ani-
mality that reveals the dark rage, the sterile madness that
lie in men’s hearts.

At the opposite pole to this nature of shadows, madness
fascinates because it is knowledge. It is knowledge, first,
because all these absurd figures are in reality elements of a
difficult, hermetic, esoteric learning. These strange forms
are situated, from the first, in the space of the Great Secret,
and the Saint Anthony who is tempted by them is not a
victim of the violence of desire but of the much more in-
sidious lure of curiosity; he is tempted by that distance and

(27)

 
  

Mavoness & CIVILIZATION

intimate knowledge which is offered, and at the same time
evaded, by the smile of the gryllos; his backward move-
ment is nothing but that step by which he keeps from cross~
ing the forbidden limits of knowledge; he knows already—
and that is his temptation—what Jéréme Cardan will say
later: “Wisdom, like other precious substances, must be
torn from the bowels of the earth.” This knowledge, so
inaccessible, so formidable, the Fool, in his innocent idiocy,
already possesses, While the man of reason and wisdom
perceives only fragmentary and all the more unnerving
images of it, the Fool bears it intact as an unbroken sphere:
that crystal ball which for all others is empty is in his eyes
filled with the density of an invisible knowledge. Brueghel
mocks the sick man who tries to penetrate this crystal
sphere, but it is this iridescent bubble of knowledge—an
absurd but infinitely precious Jantern—that sways at the
end of the stick Dulle Griet bears on her shoulder. And it is
this sphere which figures on the reverse of the Garden of
Delights. Another symbol of knowledge, the tree (the for-
bidden tree, the tree of promised immortality and of sin),
once planted in the heart of the earthly paradise, has been
uprooted and now forms the mast of the Ship of Fools, as
seen in the engraving that illustrates Josse Bade’s Srultiferae
naviculae; it is this tree, without a doubt, that sways over
Bosch’s Ship of Fools.

Whar does it presage, this wisdom of fools? Doubtless,
since it is a forbidden wisdom, it presages both the reign of
Satan and the end of the world; ultimate bliss and supreme
punishment; omnipotence on earth and the infernal fall.
The Ship of Fools sails through a landscape of delights,
where all is offered to desire, a sort of renewed paradise,
since here man no longer knows either suffering or need;
and yet he has not recovered his innocence. This false hap-
piness is the diabolical triumph of the Antichrist; it is the

(22)
 “Stultifera Navis”

End, already at hand. Apocalyptic dreams are not new, it
is true, in the fifteenth century; they are, however, very
different in nature from what they had been earlier. The
delicately fantastic iconography of the fourteenth century,
where castles are toppled like dice, where the Beast is al-
ways the traditional dragon held at bay by the Virgin, in
short where the order of God and its imminent victory are
always apparent, gives way to a vision of the world where
all wisdom is annihilated. This is the great witches’ Sabbath
of nature: mountains melt and become plains, the earth
vomits up the dead and bones tumble out of tombs; the
stars fall, the earth catches fire, all life withers and comes to
death. The end has no value as passage and promise; it is the
advent of a night in which the world’s old reason is en-
gulfed. It is enough to look at Diirer’s Horsemen of the
Apocalypse, sent by God Himself: these are no angels of
triumph and reconciliation; these are no heralds of serene
justice, but the disheveled warriors of a mad vengeance,
The world sinks into universal Fury. Victory is neither
God's nor the Devil’s: it belongs to Madness.

On all sides, madness fascinates man. The fantastic im-
ages it generates are not fleeting appearances that quickly
disappear from the surface of things. By a strange paradox,
what is born from the strangest delirium was already hid-
den, like a secret, like an inaccessible truth, in the bowels of
the earth. When man deploys the arbitrary nature of his
madness, he confronts the dark necessity of the world; the
animal that haunts his nightmares and his nights of priva-
tion is his own nature, which will lay bare hell’s pitiless
truth; the vain images of blind idiocy—such are the world’s
Magna Scientia; and already, in this disorder, in this mad
universe, is prefigured what will be the cruelty of the fi-
nale, In such images—and this is doubtless what gives them
their weight, what imposes such great coherence on their

(23)

 
  

Mavness & CivILIZATION

fantasy—the Renaissance has expressed what it appre-
hended of the threats and secrets of the world.

During the same period, the literary, philosophical, and
moral theres of madness are in an altogether different vein.

The Middle Ages had given madness, or folly, a place
in the hierarchy of vices, Beginning with the thirteenth
century, it is customarily ranked among the wicked soldiers
of the psychomachy. It figures, at Paris as at Amiens, among
the evil soldiery, and is among the twelve dualities that dis-
pute the sovereignty of the human soul: Faith and Idolatry,
Hope and Despair, Charity and Avarice, Chastity and Lust,
Prudence and Folly, Patience and Anger, Gentleness and
Harshness, Concord and Discord, Obedience and Rebel-
lion, Perseverance and Inconstancy, Fortirude and Cow-
ardice, Humility and Pride. In the Renaissance, Folly leaves
this modest place and comes to the fore. Whereas accord-
ing to Hugues de Saint-Victor the genealogical tree of the
Vices, that of the Old Adam, had pride as its root, Folly
now leads the joyous throng of all human weaknesses, Un-
contested coryphaeus, she guides them, sweeps them on,
and names them: “Recognize them here, in the group of
my companions. ,.. She whose brows are drawn is Philautia
(Self-Love), She whom you see laugh with her eyes and
applaud .with her hands is Colacia (Flattery). She who
seems half asleep is Lethe (Forgetfulness). She who leans
upon her elbows and folds her hands is Misoponia (Sloth).
She who is crowned with roses and anointed with perfume
is Hedonia (Sensuality). She whose eyes wander without
seeing is Anoia (Stupidity). She whose abundant flesh has
the hue of flowers is Tryphé (Indolence). And here among
these young women are two gods: the god of Good Cheer
and the god of Deep Sleep.”* The absolute privilege of
Folly is to reign over whatever is bad in man. But does she
not also reign indirectly over all the good he can do: over
ambition, that makes wise politicians; over avarice, that

makes wealth grow; over indiscreet curiosity, that inspires
philosophers and men of learning? Louise Labé merely fol-
lows Erasmus when she has Mercury implore the gods:
“Do not let that beautiful Lady perish who has given you
so much pleasure.”

But this new royalty has little in common with the dark
reign of which we were just speaking and which communi-
cated with the great tragic powers of this world,

True, madness attracts, but it does not fascinate. It rules
all that is easy, joyous, frivolous in the world, It is madness,
folly, which makes men “sport and rejoice,” as it has given
the gods “Genius, Beauty, Bacchus, Silenus, and the gentle
guardian of gardens.” * All within it is brilliant surface: no
enigma is concealed.

No doubt, madness has something to do with the strange
paths of knowledge. The first canto of Brant’s poem is
devoted to books and scholars; and in the engraving which
illustrates this passage in the Latin edition of 1497, we see
enthroned upon his bristling cathedra of books the Magis-
ter who wears behind his doctoral cap a fool’s cap sewn
with bells. Erasmus, in his dance of fools, reserves a large
place for scholars: after the Grammarians, the Poets, Rhet-
oricians, and Writers, come the Jurists; after them, the
“Philosophers respectable in beard and mantle”; finally the
numberless troop of the Theologians. But if knowledge is
so important in madness, it is not because the latter can
control the secrets of knowledge; on the contrary, madness
is the punishment of a disorderly and useless science. If
madness is the truth of knowledge, it is because knowledge
is absurd, and instead of addressing itself to the great book
of experience, loses its way in the dust of books and in idle
debate; learning becomes madness through the very excess
of false learning.

O vos doctores, qui grandia nomina fertis
Respicite antiquos patris, jurisque peritos.

(25)

 
  

MavNESS & CIVILIZATION

Non in candidulis pensebant dogmata libris,
Arte sed ingenua sitibundum pectus alebant.?

(O ye learned men, who bear great names,

Look back at the ancient fathers, learned in the law.
They did not weigh dogmas in shining white books,
But fed their thirsty hearts with nacural skill.)

According to the theme long familiar to popular satire,
madness appears here as the comic punishment of knowl-
edge and its ignorant presumption.

In a general way, then, madness is not linked to the
world and its subterranean forms, but rather to man, to his
weaknesses, dreams, and illusions. Whatever obscure cos-
mic manifestation there was in madness as seen by Bosch is
wiped out in Erasmus; madness no longer lies in wait for
mankind at the four corners of the earth; it insinuates itself
within man, or rather it is a subtle rapport that man main-
tains with himself, The mythological personification of
madness in Erasmus is only a literary device. In fact, only
“follies” exist—human forms of madness: “I count as many
images as there are men”; one need only glance at states,
even the wisest and best governed: “So many forms of
madness abound there, and each day sees so many new ones
born, that a thousand Democrituses would not suffice to
mock them.” There is no madness but that which is in
every man, since it is man who constitutes madness in the
attachment he bears for himself and by the illusions he
entertains. Philautia is the first figure Folly leads out in
her dance, but that is because they are linked by a privi-
leged relation: self-attachment is the first sign of madness,
but it is because man is artached to himself that he accepts
error as truth, lies as reality, violence and ugliness as beauty
and justice. “This man, uglier than a monkey, imagines
himself handsome as Nereus; that one thinks he is Euclid
because he has traced three lines with a compass; that other

(26)
 “Stultifera Navis”

one thinks he can sing like Hermogenes, whereas he is the
ass before the lyre, and his voice sounds as false as that of
the rooster pecking his hen.” In this delusive attachment to
himself, man generates his madness like a mirage. The sym-
bol of madness will henceforth be that mirror which, with-
out reflecting anything real, will secretly offer the man
who observes himself in it the dream of his own presump-
tion. Madness deals not so much with truth and the world,
as with man and whatever truth about himself he is able to
perceive.

It thus gives access to a completely moral universe. Evil
is not punishment or the end of time, but only fault and
flaw. A hundred and sixteen cantos of Brant’s poem are de~
voted to portraits of the insane passengers on the Ship:
there are misers, slanderers, drunkards; there are those who
indulge in disorder and debauchery; those who interpret
the Scriptures falsely; those who practice adultery. Locher,
Brant’s translator, notes in his Latin preface the purpose
and meaning of the work; it is concerned to teach “what
evil there may be, what good; what vices, whither virme,
whither error may lead”; and this while castigating, accord-
ing to the wickedness each man is guilty of, “the unholy,
the proud, the greedy, the extravagant, the debauched, the
voluptuous, the quick-tempered, the gluttonous, the vora-
cious, the envious, the poisoners, the faith-breakers” . . .
in short, af] that man has been able to invent in the way of
irregularities in his conduct.

In the domain of literary and philosophic expression, the
experience of madness in the fifteenth century generally
takes the form of moral satire. Nothing suggests those great
threats of invasion that haunted the imagination of the
painters. On the contrary, great pains are taken to ward it
off; one does not speak of such things. Erasmus turns our
gaze from that insanity “which the Furies let slip from hell,
each time they release their serpents”; ic is not these insane

(27)

 

 
  

Mapness & CIVILIZATION

forms that he has chosen to praise, but the “sweet illusion”
that frees the soul from “its painful cares and returns it to
the various forms of sensuality.” This calm world is easily
mastered; it readily yields its naive mysteries to the eyes of
the wise man, and the latter, by laughter, always keeps his
distance. Whereas Bosch, Brueghel, and Diirer were ter-
tibly earth-bound spectators, implicated in that madness
they saw surging around them, Erasmus observes it from
far enough away to be out of danger; he observes it from
the heights of his Olympus, and if he sings its praises, it is
because he can laugh at it with the inextinguishable laugh-
ter of the Gods. For the madness of men is a divine spec-
tacle: “In fact, could one make observations from the
Moon, as did Menippus, considering the numberless agita-
tions of the Earth, one would think one saw a swarm of
flies or gnats fighting among themselves, struggling and lay-
ing traps, stealing from one another, playing, gamboling,
falling, and dying, and one would not believe the troubles,
the tragedies that were produced by such a minute animal-
cule destined to perish so shortly.” Madness is no longer
the familiar foreignness of the world; it is merely a com-
monplace spectacle for the foreign spectator; no longer a
figure of the cosmos, but a characteristic of the aevum.

But a new enterprise was being undertaken that would
abolish the tragic experience of madness in a critical con-
sciousness. Let us ignore this phenomenon for the moment
and consider indiscriminately those figures to be found in
Don Quixote as well as in Scudéry’s novels, in King Lear as
well as in the theater of Jean de Rotrou or Tristan 'Her-
mite.

Let us begin with the most important, and the most du-
table—since the eighteenth century will still recognize its
only just erased forms: madness by romantic identification.
Its features have been fixed once and for all by Cervantes.
But the theme is tirelessly repeated: direct adaptations (the

(28)
 “Stultifera Navis”

Don Quichotte of Guérin de Bouscal was performed in
1639; two years later, he staged Le Gouvernement de
Sancho Panga), reinterpretations of a particular episode
(Pichou’s Les Folies de Cardenio is a variation on the theme
of the “Ragged Knight” of the Sierra Morena), or, in a
more indirect fashion, satire on novels of fantasy (as in
Subligny’s La Fausse Clélie, and within the story itself, as in
the episode of Julie d@’Arviane). The chimeras are trans-
mitted from author to reader, but what was fantasy on one
side becomes hallucination on the other; the writer’s strata-
gem is quite naively accepted as an image of reality. In
appearance, this is nothing but the simple-minded critique
of novels of fantasy, but just under the surface lies an
enormous anxiety concerning the relationships, in a work
of art, between the real and the imaginary, and perhaps also
concerning the confused communication between fantastic
invention and the fascinations of delirium. “We owe the
invention of the arts to deranged imaginations; the Caprice
of Painters, Poets, and Musicians is only a name moderated
in civility to express their Madness.” ® Madness, in which
the values of another age, another art, another morality are
called into question, but which also reflects—blurred and
disturbed, strangely compromised by one another in 2
common chimera-—all the forms, even the most remote, of
the human imagination.

Immediately following this first form: the madness of vain
presumption. But it is not with a literary model thar the
madman identifies; it is with himself, and by means of a
delusive attachment that enables him to grant himself all
the qualities, all the virtues or powers he lacks. He inherits
the old Philautia of Erasmus. Poor, he is rich; ugly, he ad-
mires himself; with chains still on his feet, he takes himself
for God. Such a one was Osuma’s master of arts who be-
Heved he was Neptune. Such is the ridiculous fate of the
seven characters of Desmarets de Saint-Sorlin’s Les Vision-

(29)

 
  

MavpNeEss & CIVILIZATION

naires, of Chateaufort in Cyrano de Bergerac’s Le Pédant
joué, of M. de Richesource in Sir Politik. Measureless mad-
ness, which has as many faces as the world has characters,
ambitions, and necessary illusions. Even in its extremities,
this is the least extreme of madnesses; it is, in the heart of
every man, the imaginary relation he maintains with him-
self. It engenders the commonest of his faults. ‘To denounce
it is the first and last element of all moral criticism.

To the moral world, also, belongs the madness of just
punishment, which chastises, along with the disorders of
the mind, those of the heart. Bur it has still other powers:
the punishment it inflicts multiplies by nature insofar as,
by punishing itself, it unveils the truth, The justification
of this madness is that it is truthful. Truthful since the
sufferer already experiences, in the vain whirlwind of his
hallucinations, what will for all eternity be the pain of his
punishment: Eraste, in Corneille’s Mélite, sees himself al-
ready pursued by the Eumenides and condemned by
Minos, Truthful, too, because the crime hidden from all
eyes dawns like day in the night of this strange punishment;
madness, in its wild, untamable words, proclaims its own
meaning; in its chimeras, it utters its secret truth; its cries
speak for its conscience. Thus Lady Macbeth’s delirium
reveals to those who “have known what they should not”
words long uttered only to “dead pillows.”

Then the last type of madness: that of desperate passion.
Love disappointed in its excess, and especially love deceived
by the fatality of death, has no other recourse but madness.
As long as there was an object, mad love was more love
than madness; left to itself, it pursues itself in the void of
delirium. Punishment of a passion too abjectly abandoned
to its violence? No. doubt; but this punishment is also a
relief; it spreads, over the irreparable absence, the mercy of
imaginary presences; it recovers, in the paradox of innocent
joy or in the heroism of senseless pursuits, the vanished

(30)
  

“Stultifera Navis”

form. If it leads to death, it is a death in which the lovers
will never be separated again. This is Ophelia’s last song, this
is the delirium of Ariste in La Folie du sage. But above all,
this is the bitter and sweet madness of King Lear.

In Shakespeare, madness is allied to death and murder; in
Cervantes, images are controlled by the presumption and
the complacencies of the imaginary. These are supreme
models whose imitators deflect and disarm them. Doubtless,
both testify more to a tragic experience of madness appear-
ing in the fifteenth century, than to a critical and moral
experience of Unreason developing in their own epoch.
Outside of time, they establish a link with a meaning about
to be lost, and whose continuity will no longer survive
except in darkness, But it is by comparing their work, and
what it maintains, with the meanings thac develop among
their contemporaries or imitators, that we may decipher
what is happening, at the beginning of the seventeenth cen-
tury, in the literary experience of madness.

In Shakespeare or Cervantes, madness still occupies an
extreme place, in that it is beyond appeal. Nothing ever
restores it either to truth or to reason. It leads only to
laceration and thence to death. Madness, in its vain words, is
not vanity; the void that fills it is a “disease beyond my
practice,” as the doctor says about Lady Macbeth; it is
already the plenitude of death; a madness that has no need
of a physician, but only of divine mercy. The sweet joy
Ophelia finally regains reconciles her with no happiness,
her mad song is as close to the essential as the “cry of
women” that announces through the corridors of Mac-
beth’s castle that “the Queen is dead.” Certainly Don
Quixote’s death occurs in a peaceful landscape, which at
the last moment has rejoined reason and truth. Suddenly
the Knight’s madness has grown conscious of itself, and in
his own eyes trickles out in nonsense. But is this sudden
wisdom of his folly anything but “a new madness that had

(37)

 
  

Mavness & CIVILIZATION

jest come into his head”? The equivocation is endlessly
reversible and cannot be resolved, ultimately, except by
death itself, Madness dissipated can be only the same thing
as the imminence of the end; “and even one of the signs by
which they realized that the sick man was dying, was that
he had returned so easily from madness to reason.” But
death itself does not bring peace; madness will still triumph
—a truth mockingly eternal, beyond the end of a life
which yet had been delivered from madness by this very
end. Ironically, Don Quixote’s insane life pursues and im-
mortalizes him only by his insanity; madness is still the
imperishable life of death: “Here lies the famous hidalgo
who carried valor to such lengths that it was said death
could not triumph over life by his demise.”

But very soon, madness leaves these ultimate regions
where Cervantes and Shakespeare had situated it; and in the
literature of the early seventeenth century it occupies, by
preference, a median place; it thus constitutes the knot
more than the denouement, the peripity rather than the
final release. Displaced in the economy of narrative
and dramatic structures, it authorizes the manifestation of
truth and the return of reason.

Thus madness is no longer considered in its tragic reality,
in the absolute laceration that gives it access to the other
world; but only in the irony of its illusions. It is not a real
punishment, but only the image of punishment, thus a pre-
tense; it can be linked only to the appearance of a crime or
to the illusion of a death. Though Ariste, in Tristan |’Her-
mite’s La Folie du sage, goes mad at the news of his daugh-
ter’s death, the fact is that she is not really dead; when
Eraste, in Mélite, sees himself pursued by the Eumenides
and dragged before Minos, it is for a double crime which
he might have committed, which he might have wanted to
commit, but which in fact has not occasioned any real
death. Madness is deprived of its dramatic seriousness; it is

(32)
 “Stultifera Navis”

punishment or despair only in the dimension of error. Its
dramatic function exists only insofar as we are concerned
with a false drama; a chimerical form in which only sup-
posed faults, illusory murders, ephemeral disappearances
are involved.

Yet this absence of seriousness does not keep madness
from being essential—even more essential than it had been,
for if it brings illusion to its climax, it is from this point that
illusion is undone. In the madness in which his error has
enveloped him, the character involuntarily begins to un-
ravel the web. Accusing himself, he speaks the truth in spite
of himself. In Mélite, for example, all the stratagems the
hero has accumulated to deceive others are turned against
himself, and he becomes their first victim, believing that he
is guilty of the deaths of his rival and his mistress. But in his
delirium, he blames himself for having invented a whole
series of love letters; the truth comes to light, in and
through madness, which, provoked by the illusion of a de-
nouement, actually resolves the real imbroglio of which it is
both cause and effect. To put it another way, madness is
the false. punishment of a false solution, but by its own
virtue it brings to light the real problem, which can then be
truly resolved. It conceals beneath error the secret enter-
prise of truth. It is this function of madness, both ambigu-
ous and central, that the author of L’Ospital des fous em-
ploys when he portrays a pair of lovers who, to escape
their pursuers, pretend to be mad and hide among madmen;
in a fit of simulated dementia, the girl, who is dressed as a
boy, pretends to believe she is a girl—which she really is—
thus uttering, by the reciprocal neutralization of these two
pretenses, the truth which in the end will triumph.

Madness is the purest, most total form of qui pro quo; it
takes the false for the true, death for life, man for woman,
the beloved for the Erinnys and the victim for Minos. But
it is also the most rigorously necessary form of the qui pro

(33)

 
  

Manness & CIVILIZATION

quo in the dramatic economy, for it needs no external ele-
ment to reach a true resolution. It has merely to carry its
illusion to the point of truth. Thus it is, at the very heart of
the structure, in its mechanical center, both a feigned con-
clusion, pregnant with a secret “starting over,” and the first
step toward what will tum out to be the reconciliation
with reason and truth. It marks the point toward which
converge, apparently, the tragic destinies of the characters,
and from which, in reality, emerge the lines leading to hap-
piness regained. In madness equilibrium is established, but it
masks that equilibrium beneath the cloud of illusion, be-
neath feigned disorder; the rigor of the architecture is con-
cealed beneath the cunning arrangement of these disordered
violences. The sudden bursts of life, the random gestures
and words, the wind of madness that suddenly breaks lines,
shatters attitudes, rumples draperies—while the strings are
merely being pulled tighter—this is the very type of ba-
roque trompe-l'ceil. Madness is the great trompe-foeil in
the tragicomic structures of preclassical literature.

This was understood by Georges de Scudéry, who made
his Comédie des comédiens a theater of theater, situating his
play, from the start, in the interacting illusions of madness.
One group of actors takes the part of spectators, another
that of actors, The former must pretend to take the decor
for reality, the play for life, while in realiry these actors are
performing in a real decor; on the other hand, the latter
must pretend to play the part of actors, while in fact, quite
simply, they are actors acting. A double impersonation in
which each element is doubled, thus forming that re-
newed exchange of the real and the illusory which is itself
the dramatic meaning of madness. “I do not know,” Mon-
dory says in the prologue to Scudéry’s play, “what ex-
travagance has today come over my companions, but it is
so great that I am forced to believe that some spell has
robbed them of their reason, and the worst of it is that they

are trying to make me lose mine, and you yours as well.
They wish to persuade me that I am not on a stage, that
this is the city of Lyons, that over there is an inn, and
there an innyard where actors who are not ourselves, yet
who are, are performing a Pastoral.” In this extravaganza,
the theater develops its truth, which is illusion. Which is,
in the strict sense, madness.

The classical experience of madness is born. The great
threat that dawned on the horizon of the fifteenth century
subsides, the disturbing powers that inhabit Bosch’s paint-
ing have lost their violence. Forms remain, now transparent
and docile, forming a cortége, the inevitable procession of
reason. Madness has ceased to be—at the limits of the
world, of man and death—an eschatological figure; the
darkness has dispersed on which the eyes of madness were
fixed and out of which the forms of the impossible were
born. Oblivion falls upon the world navigated by the free
slaves of the Ship of Fools. Madness will no longer proceed
from a point within the world to a point beyond, on its
strange voyage; it will never again be that fugitive and
absolute limit. Behold it moored now, made fast among
things and men. Retained and maintained. No longer a ship
but a hospital.

Scarcely a century after the career of the mad ships, we
note the appearance of the theme of the “Hospital of Mad-
men,” the “Madhouse.” Here every empty head, fixed and
classified according to the true reason of men, utters con-
tradiction and irony, the double language of Wisdom:
“. « . the Hospital of incurable Madmen, where are recited
from end to end all the follies and fevers of the mind, by
men as well as women, 2 task no less useful than enjoyable,
and necessary for the acquisition of true wisdom.” ” Here
each form of madness finds its proper place, its distinguish-
ing mark, and its tutelary divinity: frenzied and ranting

(35)

 
  

Mavness & CIVILIZATION

madness, symbolized by a fool astride a chair, struggles be-
neath Minerva’s gaze; the somber melancholics that roam
the countryside, solitary and avid wolves, have as their god
Jupiter, patron of animal metamorphoses; then come the
“mad drunkards,” the “madmen deprived of memory and
understanding,” the “madmen benumbed and half-dead,”
the “madmen of giddy and empty heads”... All this
world of disorder, in perfect order, pronounces, each in his
torn, the Praise of Reason. Already, in this “Hospital,”
confinement has succeeded embarkation.

Tamed, madness preserves all the appearances of its
reign. It now takes part in the measures of reason and in the
labor of truth. It plays on the surface of things and in the
glitter of daylight, over all the workings of appearances,
over the ambiguity of reality and illusion, over all that in-
determinate web, ever rewoven and broken, which both
unites and separates truth and appearance. It hides and
manifests, it utters truth and falsehood, it is light and
shadow. It shimmers, 2 central and indulgenc figure, al-
ready precarious in this baroque age.

Let us not be surprised to come upon it so often in the
fictions of the novel and the theater. Let us not be surprised
to find it actually prowling through the streets. Thousands
of times, Francois Colletet has met it there:

I see, in this thoroughfare,

A natural, followed by children.

. . » Consider this unhappy wretch;
Poor mad fool, what will he do
With so many rags and tatters? .. .
Thave seen such wild lunatics
Shouting insults in the streets . . .

Madness traces a very familiar silhouette in the social
landscape. A new and lively pleasure is taken in the old
confraternities of madmen, in their festivals, their gather-

(36)

ings, their speeches. Men argue passionately for or against
Nicolas Joubert, better known by the name of Angoule-
vent, who declares himself Prince of Fools, a title disputed
by Valenti le Comte and Jacques Resneau: there follow
pamphlets, a trial, arguments; his lawyer declares and certi-
fies him to be “an empty head, a gutted gourd, lacking in
common sense; a cane, a broken brain, that has neither
spring nor whole wheel in his head.” Bluet d’ Arbéres, who
calls himself Comte de Permission, is a protégé of the Cré-
quis, the Lesdiguiéres, the Bouillons, the Nemours; in 1602
he publishes—-or someone publishes for him—his works,
in which he warns the reader that “he does not know how
to read or write, and has never learned,” but that he is
animated “by the inspiration of God and the Angels.”
Pierre Dupuis, whom Régnier mentions in his sixth satire,
is, according to Brascambille, “an archfool in a long robe”;
he himself in his “Remontrance sur le réveil de Maitre
Guillaume” states that he has “a mind elevated as far as the
antechamber of the third degree of the moon.” And many
other characters present in Régnier’s fourteenth satire.

This world of the early seventeenth century is strangely
hospitable, in all senses, to madness. Madness is here, at the
heart of things and of men, an ironic sign that misplaces the
guideposts berween the real and the chimerical, barely re-
taining the memory of the great tragic threats—a life more
disturbed than disturbing, an absurd agitation in society,
the mobility of reason.

But new requirements are being generated:

THE GREAT
CONFINEMENT

Compelle intrare.

By a strange act of force, the classical age was to reduce to
silence the madness whose voices the Renaissance had just
liberated, but whose violence it had already tamed.

Ic is common knowledge that the seventeenth century
created enormous houses of confinement; it is less com-
monly known that more than one out of every hundred
inhabitants of the city of Paris found themselves confined
there, within several months. It is common knowledge that
absolute power made use of lettres de cachet and arbitrary
measures of imprisonment; what is less familiar is the judi-
cial conscience that could inspire such practices. Since
Pinel, Tuke, Wagnitz, we know that madmen were sub-
jected to the regime of this confinement for a century and
a half, and that they would one day be discovered in the

(38)
 The Great Confinement

wards of the Hépital Général, in the cells of prisons; they
would be found mingled with the population of the work-
houses or Zuchthdusern. But it has rarely been made clear
what their status was there, what the meaning was of this
proximity which seemed to assign the same homeland to the
poor, to the unemployed, to prisoners, and to the insane. It
is within the walls of confinement that Pinel and nineteenth-
century psychiatry would come upon madmen; it is there
~let us remember—that they would leave them, not with-
out boasting of having “delivered” them. From the middle
of the seventeenth century, madness was linked with this
country of confinement, and with the act which designated
confinement as its natural abode.

A date can serve as a landmark: 1656, the decree that
founded, in Paris, the Hépital Général. At first glance, this
is merely a reform—little more than an administrative re-
organization. Several already existing establishments are
grouped under a single administration: the Salpétriére, re-
built under the preceding reign to house an arsenal; Bicétre,
which Louis XIII had wanted to give to the Commandery
of Saint Louis as a rest home for military invalids; “the
House and the Hospital of La Pitié, the larger as well as the
smaller, those of Le Refuge, situated in the Faubourg Saint-
Victor, the House and Hospital of Scipion, the House of
La Savonnerie, with all the lands, places, gardens, houses,
and buildings thereto appertaining.” All were now as-
signed to the poor of Paris “of both sexes, of all ages and
from all localities, of whatever breeding and birth, in what-
ever state they may be, able-bodied or invalid, sick or con-
valescent, curable or incurable.” These establishments had
to accept, lodge, and feed those who presented themselves or
those sent by royal or judicial authority; it was also neces-
sary to assure the subsistence, the appearance, and the gen-
eral order of those who could not find room, but who
might or who deserved to be there. This responsibility was

(39)

 
  

Mavbness & CIVILIZATION

entrusted to directors appointed for life, who exercised
their powers, not only in the buildings of the Hépital but
throughout the city of Paris, over all those who came un-
der their jurisdiction: “They have all power of authority,
of direction, of administration, of commerce, of police, of
jurisdiction, of correction and punishment over all rhe poor
of Paris, both within and without the Hépital Général.”
The directors also appointed a doctor at a salary of one
thousand livres a year; he was to reside at La Pitié, but had
to visit each of the houses of the Hépital twice a week.

From the very start, one thing is clear: the Hdpital Gé-
néral is not a medical establishment. It is rather a sort of
semijudicial structure, an administrative entity which,
along with the already constituted powers, and outside of
the courts, decides, judges, and executes. “The directors
having for these purposes stakes, irons, prisons, and dun-
geons in the said Hopital Général and the places thereto
appertaining so much as they deem necessary, no appeal
will be accepted from the regulations they establish within
the said hospital; and as for such regulations as intervene
from without, they will be executed according to their
form and tenor, notwithstanding opposition or whatsoever
appeal made or to be made, and without prejudice to these,
and for which, notwithstanding all defense or suits for jus-
tice, no distinction will be made.”? A quasi-absolute sover-
eignty, jurisdiction without appeal, a writ of execution
against which nothing can prevail—the Hépital Général is
a strange power that the King establishes between the po-
lice and the courts, at the limits of the law: a third order of
repression. The insane whom Pinel would find at Bicétre
. and at La Salpétriére belonged to this world.

In its functioning, or in its purpose, the Hépital Général
had nothing to do with any medical concept. It was an
instance of order, of the monarchical and bourgeois order
being organized in France during this period. It was di-

(40)
  

The Great Confinement

rectly linked with the royal power which placed it under
the authority of the civil government alone; the Grand
Almonry of the Realm, which previously formed an eccle-
siastical and spiritual mediation in the politics of assistance,
was abruptly elided. The King decreed: “We choose to be
guardian and protector of the said Hépital Général as being
of our royal founding and especially as it does not depend
in any manner whatsoever upon our Grand Almonry, nor
upon any of our high officers, but is to be totally exempt
from the direction, visitation, and jurisdiction of the officers
of the General Reform and others of the Grand Al-
monry, and from all others to whom we forbid all knowl-
edge and jurisdiction in any fashion or manner whatso-
ever.” The origin of the project had been parliamentary,
and the first ewo administrative heads appointed were the
first President of the Parlement and the Procurator Gen-
eral. But they were soon supplemented by the Archbishop
of Paris, the President of the Court of Assistance, the Presi-
dent of the Court of Exchequer, the Chief of Police, and
the Provost of Merchants. Henceforth the “Grand Bu-
teau” had no more than a deliberative role. The actual ad-
ministration and the real responsibilities were entrusted to
agents recruited by co-optation. These were the true gov-
ernors, the delegates of royal power and bourgeois fortune
to the world of poverty. The Revolution was able to give
them this testimony: “Chosen from the best families of the
bourgeoisie, . . . they brought to their administration dis-
interested views and pure intentions.”*

This structure proper to the monarchical and bourgeois
order of France, contemporary with its organization. in
absolutist forms, soon extended its network over the whole
of France. An edict of the King, dated June 16, 1676, pre~
scribed the establishment of an “bépital général in each city
of his kingdom.” Occasionally the measure had been an-
ticipated by the local authorities; the bourgeoisie of Lyons

_(4t)

 
  

Mavvess & CIVILIZATION

had already organized in 1612 2 charity establishment that
functioned in an analogous manner. The Archbishop of
Tours was proud to declare on July 10, 1676, that his
“archepiscopal city has happily foreseen the pious inten-
tions of the King and erected an bépital général called La
Charité even before the one in Paris, whose order has
served as a model for all those subsequently established,
within or outside the kingdom.” The Charité of Tours, in
fact, had been founded in 1656, and the King had endowed
it with an income of four thousand livres. Over the entire
face of France, hépitaux généraux were opened; on the eve
of the Revolution, they were to be found in thirty-two
provincial cities.

Even if it had been deliberately excluded from the or-
ganization of the hédpitaux généraux—by complicity,
doubtless, between royal power and bourgeoisie—the
Church nonetheless did not remain a stranger to the move-
ment. It reformed its own hospital insticutions, redistrib-
uted the wealth of its foundations, even created congrega-
tions whose purposes were rather analogous to those of the
Hépital Général. Vincent de Paul reorganized Saint-La-
zare, the most important of the former lazar houses of
Paris; on January 7, 1632, he signed a contract in the name
of the Congregationists of the Mission with the “Priory” of
Saint-Lazare, which was now to receive “persons detained
by order of His Majesty.” The Order of Good Sons
opened hospitals of this nature in the north of France. The
Brothers of Saint John of God, called into France in 1602,
founded first the Charité of Paris in the Faubourg Saint-
Germain, then Charenton, into which they moved on May
10, 1645. Not far from Paris, they also operated the Charité
of Senlis, which opened on October 27, 1670. Some years
before, the Duchess of Bouillon had donated them the
buildings and benefices of La Maladrerie, founded in the
fourteenth century by Thibaut de Champagne, at Chateau-

(42)
     

 
 

The Great Confinement

Thierry. They administered also the Charités of Saint-Yon,
Pontorson, Cadillac, and Romans. In 1699, the Lazarists
founded in Marseilles the establishment that was to become
the H6pital Saint-Pierre. Then, in the eighteenth century,
came Armentiéres (1712), Maréville (1714), the Good
Savior of Caen (1735); Saint-Meins of Rennes opened
shortly before the Revolution (1780).

The phenomenon has European dimensions. The con-
stitution of an absolute monarchy and the intense Catholic
renaissance during the Counter-Reformation produced in
France a very particular character of simultaneous compe-
tition and complicity berween the government and the
Church, Elsewhere it assumed quite different forms; but its
localization in time was just as precise. The great hospitals,
houses of confinement, establishments of religion and pub-
lic order, of assistance and punishment, of governmental
charity and welfare measures, are a phenomenon of the
classical period: as universal as itself and almost contempo-
rary with its birth. In German-speaking countries, it was
marked by the creation of houses of correction, the Zucht-
bausern; the first antedates the French houses of ‘confine-
ment (except for the Charité of Lyons); it opened in
Hamburg around 1620. The others were founded in the
second half of the century: Basel (1667), Breslau (1668),
Frankfort (1684), Spandau (1684), Kénigsberg (169r).
They continued to multiply in the eighteenth century;
Leipzig first in 1701, then Halle and Cassel in 1717 and
1720, later Brieg and Osnabriick (1756), and finally Tor-
gau in 1777.

In England the origins of confinement are more remote.
An act of 1575 covering both “the punishment of vaga-
bonds and the relief of the poor” prescribed the construc-
tion of houses of correction, to number at lease one per
county. Their upkeep was to be assured by a tax, but the
public was encouraged to make voluntary donations. It ap-

(43)

 
  

Mavness & CIVILIZATION

pears, however, that in this form the measure was scarcely
ever applied, since, some years later, it was decided to au-
thorize private enterprise: it was no longer necessary to
obtain an official permit to open a hospital or a house of
correction; anyone who pleased might do so. At the begin-
ning of the seventeenth century, a general reorganization: a
fine of five pounds was imposed on any justice of the peace
who had not established one in the area of his jurisdiction;
the houses were to install trades, workshops, and factories
(milling, spinning, weaving) to aid in their upkeep and as-
sure their inmates of work; a judge was to decide who was
qualified to be sent there. The development of these “bride-
wells” was not too considerable; often they were gradually
absorbed by the prisons to which they were attached; the
practice never spread as far as Scotland. On the other hand,
the workhouses were destined to greater success. They
date from the second half of the seventeenth century. An
act of 1670 defined their status, appointed officers of justice
to oversee the collection of taxes and the administration of
sums that would permit their functioning, and entrusted
the supreme control of their administration to a justice of
the peace, In 1697 several parishes of Bristol united to form
the first workhouse in England, and to designate the corpo-
ration that would administer it, Another was established ac
Worcester in 1703, a third the same year at Dublin; then at
Plymouth, Norwich, Hull, and Exeter. By the end of the
eighteenth century, there were 126 of them. The Gilbert
Act of 1792 gives the parishes facilities to create new ones;
at the same time, the control and authority of the justice of
the peace is reinforced; to keep the workhouses from be-
coming hospitals, it is recommended that all contagious in-
valids be turned away.

In several years, an entire network had spread across Ex-
rope. John Howard, at the end of the eighteenth century,
undertook to investigate it; in England, Holland, Germany,

 INTRODUCTION

Micuet Foucavutr has achieved something truly creative
in this book on the history of madness during the so-called
classical age: the end of the sixteenth and the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries. Rather than to review histori-
cally the concept of madness, the author has chosen to re-
create, mostly from original documents, mental illness,
folly, and unreason as they must have existed in their time,
place, and proper social perspective. In a sense, he has tried
to re-create the negative part of the concept, that which
has disappeared under the retroactive influence of present-
day ideas and the passage of time. Too many historical
books about psychic disorders look at the past in the light
of the present; they single out only what has positive and
direct relevance to present-day psychiatry. This book be-
longs to the few which demonstrate how skillful, sensitive
scholarship uses history to enrich, deepen, and reveal
new avenues for thought and investigation.

No oversimplifications, no black-and-white statements,
no sweeping generalizations are ever allowed in this book;
folly is brought back to life as a complex social phenome-
non, part and parcel of the human condition. Most of the
time, for the sake of clarity, we examine madness through
one of its facets; as M. Foucault animates one facet of the
problem after the other, he always keeps them related to
each other. The end of the Middle Ages emphasized the
comic, bur just as often the tragic aspect of madness, as in
Tristan and Iseult, for example, The Renaissance, with

The Great Confinement

France, Italy, Spain, he made pilgrimages to all the chief
centers of confinement—“hospitals, prisons, jails”—and his
philanthropy was outraged by the fact that the same walls
could contain those condemned by common law, young
men who disturbed their families’ peace or who squandered
their goods, people without profession, and the insane.
Proof that even at this period, a certain meaning had been
lost: that which had se hastily, so spontaneously summoned
into being all over Europe the category of classical order we
call confinement. In a hundred and fifty years, confinement
had become the abusive amalgam of heterogeneous ele-
ments. Yet at its origin, there must have existed a unity
which justified its urgency; between these diverse forms
and the classical period that called them into being, there
must have been a principle of cohesion we cannot evade
under the scandal of pre-Revolutionary sensibility. What,
then, was the reality represented by this entire population
which almost overnight found itself shut up, excluded
more severely than the lepers? We must not forget that 4
few years after its foundation, the Hépital Général of Paris
alone contained six thousand persons, or around one per
cent of the population. There must have. formed, silently
and doubtless over the course of many years, a social sensi-
bility, common to European culture, that suddenly began
to manifest itself in the second half of the seventeenth cen-
tury; it was this sensibility that suddenly isolated the cate~
gory destined to populate the places of confinement. To
inhabit the reaches Jong since abandoned by the lepers,
they chose a group that to our eyes is strangely mixed and
confused. But what is for us merely an undifferentiated
sensibility must have been, for those living in the classical
age, a clearly articulated perception. It is this mode of per-

tomed to define by the privileges of Reason. The act

(45)

which, by tracing the locus of confinement, conferred
upon it its power of segregation and provided a new
homeland for madness, though it may be coherent and
concerted, is not simple. It organizes into a complex unity 2
new sensibility to poverty and to the duties of assistance,
new forms of reaction to the economic problems of unem-
ployment and idleness, a new ethic of work, and also the
dream of a city where moral obligation was joined to civil
law, within the authoritarian forms of constraint, Ob-
scurely, these themes are present during the construction of
the cities of confinement and their organization. They give
a meaning to this ritual, and explain in part the mode in
which madness was perceived, and experienced, by the
classical age.

Confinement, that massive phenomenen, the signs of
which are found all across eighteenth-century Europe, is a
“police” matter. Police, in the precise sense that the classical
epoch gave to it—that is, the totality of measures which
make work possible and necessary for all those who could
not live without it; the question Voltaire would soon
formulate, Colbert’s contemporaries had already asked:
“Since you have established yourselves as a people, have
you not yet discovered the secret of forcing all the rich to
make all the poor work? Are you still ignorant of the first
principles of the police?”

Before having the medical meaning we give it, or that at
least we like to suppose it has, confinement was required by
something quite different from any concern with curing
the sick. What made it necessary was an imperative of la-
bor. Our philanthropy prefers to recognize the signs of a
benevolence toward sickness where there is only a con-
demnation of idleness.

Let us return to the first moments of the “Confinement,”
and to that royal edict of April 27, 1656, that led to the

(46)
 The Great Confinement

creation of the Hépital Général. From the beginning, the
institution set itself the task of preventing “mendicancy
and idleness as the source of all disorders.” In fact, this was
the last of the great measures that had been taken since the
Renaissance to put an end to unemployment or at least to
begging.‘ In 1532, the Parlement of Paris decided to arrest
beggars and force them to work in the sewers of the city,
chained in pairs. The situation soon reached critical pro-
portions: on March 23, 1534, the order was given “to poor
scholars and indigents” to leave the city, while it was for-
bidden “henceforth to sing hymns before images in the
streets.” The wars of religion muluplied this suspect
crowd, which included peasants driven from their farms,
disbanded soldiers or deserters, unemployed workers, im-
poverished students, and the sick. When Henri IV began
the siege of Paris, the city, which had less than 100,000
inhabitants, contained more than 30,000 beggars. An eco-
nomic revival began early in the seventeenth century; it
was decided to reabsorb by force the unemployed who
had not regained a place in society; a decree of the Parle-
ment dated 1606 ordered the beggars of Paris to be
whipped in the public square, branded on the shoulder,
shorn, and then driven from the city; to keep them from
returning, an ordinance of 1607 established companies of
archers at all the city gates to forbid entry to indigents.
When the effects of the economic renaissance disappeared
with the Thirty Years’ War, the problems of mendicancy
and idleness reappeared; until the middle of the century,
the regular increase of taxes hindered manufactures and
augmented unemployment, This was the period of upris-
ings in Paris (1621), in Lyons (1652), in Rouen (1639).
At the same time, the world of labor was disorganized by
the appearance of new economic structures; as the large
manufactories developed, the guilds lost their powers and
their rights, the “General Regulations” prohibited all as-

(47)

 

 

 
  

Mavness & CIVILIZATION

semblies of workers, all leagues, all “‘associations.” In many
professions, however, the guilds were reconstituted. They
were prosecuted, but it seems that the Parlements showed a
certain apathy; the Parlement of Normandy disclaimed all
competence to judge the rioters of Rouen. This is doubt-
less why the Church intervened and accused the workers’
secret gatherings of sorcery. A decree of the Sorbonne, in
1655, proclaimed “guilty of sacrilege and mortal sin” all
those who were found in such bad company.

In this silent conflict that opposed the severity of the
Church to the indulgence of the Parlements, the creation of
the Hépital was certainly, at least in the beginning, a vic-
tory for the Parlement, It was, in any case, a new solution.
For the first time, purely negative measures of exclusion
were replaced by a measure of confinement, the unem-
ployed person was no longer driven away or punished; he
was taken in charge, at the expense of the nation but at the
cost of his individual liberty. Between him and society, an
implicit system of obligation was established: he had the
right to be fed, bur he must accept the physical and moral
constraint of confinement.

It is this entire, rather undifferentiated mass at which the
edict of 1657 is aimed; a population without resources,
without social moorings, a class rejected or rendered mobile
by new economic developments. Less than two weeks after
ir was signed, the edict was read and proclaimed in the
streets. Paragraph 9: “We expressly prohibit and forbid all
persons of either sex, of any locality and of any age, of
whatever breeding and birth, and in whatever condition
they may be, able-bodied or invalid, sick or convalescent,
curable or incurable, to beg in the city and suburbs of
Paris, neither in the churches, nor at the doors of such, nor
at the doors of houses nor in the streets, nor anywhere else
in public, nor in secret, by day or night... under pain of
being whipped for the first offense, and for the second

(48)
 The Great Confinement

condemned to the galleys if men and boys, banished if
women and girls.” The year efter-Sunday, May 13, 1657
—a high mass in honor of the Holy Ghost was sung at the
Church of Saint-Louis de la Pitié, and on the morning of
Monday the fourteenth, the militia, which was to become,
in the mythology of popular terror, “the archers of the
Hpital,” began to hunt down beggars and herd them into
the different buildings of the Hépital. Four years later, La
Salpétriére housed 1,460 women and small children; at La
Pitié there were 98 boys, 897 girls between seven and
seventeen, and 9; women; at Bicétre, 1,615 adult men; at
La Savonnerie, 305 boys between eight and thirteen; fi-
nally, Scipion lodged 30 pregnant women, nursing women,
and very young children, Initially, married people, even in
need, were not admitted; the administration was instructed
to feed them at home; but soon, thanks to a grant from
Mazarin, it was possible to lodge them at La Salpéeri¢re. In
all, between five and six thousand persons.

Throughout Europe, confinement had the same mean-
ing, at least if we consider its origin. Ir constituted one of
the answers the seventeenth century gave to an economic
crisis that affected the entire Western world: reduction of
wages, unemployment, scarcity of coin—the coincidence
of these phenomena probably being due to a crisis in the
Spanish economy. Even England, of all the countries of
Western Europe the least dependent on the system, had to
solve the same problems. Despite all the measures taken to
avoid unemployment and the reduction of wages, poverty
continued to spread in the nation. In 1622 appeared a
pamphlet, Grievous Groan for the Poor, attributed to
Thomas Dekker, which, emphasizing the danger, condemns
the general negligence: “Though the number of the poor
do daily increase, all things yet worketh for the worst in
their behalf; . . . many of these parishes curneth forth
their poor, yea, and their lusty labourers that will not

(49)

 

 
  

Mavness & CIVILIZATION

work . . . to beg, filch, and steal for their maintenance, so
that the country is pitifully pestered with them.” It was
feared that they would overrun the country, and since they
could not, as on the Continent, cross the border into an-
other nation, it was proposed that they be “banished and
conveyed to the New-found Land, the East and West In-
dies.” In 1630, the King established a commission to assure
the rigorous observance of the Poor Laws. That same year,
it published a series of “orders and directions”; it recom-
mended prosecuting beggars and vagabonds, as well as “all
those who live in idleness and will not work for reasonable
wages or who spend what they have in taverns.” They
must be punished according to Jaw and placed in houses of
correction; as for those with wives and children, investiga-
tion must be made as to whether they were married and
their children baptized, “for these people live like savages
without being married, nor buried, nor baptized; and it is
this licentious liberty which causes so many to rejoice in
vagabondage.” Despite the recovery that began in England
in the middle of the century, the problem was still unsolved
in Cromwell’s time, for the Lord Mayor complains of “this
vermin that troops about the city, disturbing public order,
assaulting carriages, demanding alms with loud cries at the
doors of churches and private houses.”

For a long time, the house of correction or the premises
of the Hépital Général would serve to contain the unem-
ployed, the idle, and vagabonds. Each time a crisis occurred
and the number of the poor sharply increased, the houses
of confinement regained, at least for a time, their initial
economic significance. In the middle of the eighteenth cen-
tury, there was another great crisis: 12,000 begging work-
ers at Roven and as many at Tours; at Lyons the manufac-
tories closed. The Count d’Argenson, “who commands the
department of Paris and the marshalseas,” gave orders “to
arrest all the beggars of the kingdom; the marshalseas will

(so)
 The Great Confinement

perform this task in the countryside, while the same thing
is done in Paris, whither they are sure not to return, being
entrapped on all sides.”

But outside of the periods of crisis, confinement acquired
another meaning. Its repressive function was combined
with a new use. It was no longer merely a question of
confining those out of work, but of giving work to those
who had been confined and thus making them contribute to
the prosperity of all. The alternation is clear: cheap man-
power in the periods of full employment and high salaries;
and in periods of unemployment, reabsorption of the idle
and social protection against agitation and uprisings. Let us
not forget that the firsr houses of confinement appear in
England in the most industrialized parts of the country:
Worcester, Norwich, Bristol; that the first bdpital général
was opened in Lyons, forty years before that of Paris, that
Hamburg was the first German city to have its Zuchthaus,
in 1620. Its regulations, published in 1622, were quite pre-
cise. The internees must all work. Exact record was kept of
the value of their work, and they were paid a fourth of it.
For work was not only an occupation; it must be produc-
tive. The eight directors of the house established a general
plan. The Werkmeister assigned a task to each, and ascer-
tained at the end of the week that it had been accom-
plished. The rule of work would remain in effect until the
end of the eighteenth century, since John Howard could
still attest that they were “knitting and spinning; weaving
stockings, linen, hair, and wool—and rasping logwood and
hartshorn. The quota of a robust man who shreds such
wood is forty-five pounds a day. Some men and horses
labour at a fulling-mill. A blacksmith works there without
cease.” Each house of confinement in Germany had its
specialty: spinning was paramount in Bremen, Brunswick,
Munich, Breslau, Berlin; weaving in Hanover. The men
shredded wood in Bremen and Hamburg. In Nuremberg

(57)

 
 Mavoness & CIVILIZATION

they polished optical glass; at Mainz the principal labor was
the milling of flour.

The first houses of correction were opened in England
during a full economic recession. The act of 1610 recom-
mended only joining certain mills and weaving and carding
shops to all houses of correction in order to occupy the
pensioners. But what had been a moral requirement became
an economic tactic when commerce and industry recovered
after 1651, the economic situation having been re-estab-
lished by the Navigation Act and the lowering of the dis-
count rate. All able-bodied manpower was to be used to the
best advantage, that is, as cheaply as possible. When John
Carey established his workhouse project in Bristol, he
ranked the need for work first: “The poor of both sexes

. may be employed in beating hemp, dressing and
spinning flax, or in carding wool and cotton.” At Wor-
cester, they manufactured clothes and stuffs; a workshop
for children was established. All of which did not always
proceed without difficulties. It was suggested that the
workhouses might enter the local industries and markets,
on the principle perhaps that such cheap production would
have a regulatory effect on the sale price. But the manufac-
tories protested. Daniel Defoe noticed that by the effect of
the too easy competition of the workhouses, poverty was
created in one area on the pretext of suppressing it in an~
other; “it is giving to one what you take away from an-
other; putting a vagabond in an honest man’s employment,
and putting diligence on the tenters to find out some other
work to maintain his family.” Faced with this danger of
competition, the authorities let the work gradually disap-
pear. The pensioners could no longer earn even enough
to pay for their upkeep; at times it was necessary to put
them in prison so that they might at least have free bread.
As for the bridewells, as Howard attested, there were few
“Sn which any work is done, or can be done. The prisoners

(52)

 
  

The Great Confinement

have neither tools, nor materials of any kind: but spend
their time in sloth, profaneness and debauchery.”

When the Hépital Général was created in Paris, it was
intended above all to suppress beggary, rather than to pro-
vide an occupation for the internees. It seems, however,
that Colbert, like his English contemporaries, regarded
assistance through work as both a remedy to unemployment
and a stimulus to the development of manufactories. In any
case, in the provinces the directors were to see that the
houses of charity had a certain economic significance, “All
the poor who are capable of working must, upon work
days, do what is necessary to avoid idleness, which is the
mother of all evils, as well as to accustom them to honest
toil and also to earning some part of their sustenance.”

Sometimes there were even arrangements which permit-
ted private entrepreneurs to utilize the manpower of the
asylums for their own profit. Ic was stipulated, for example,
according to an agreement made in 1708, that an entre-
preneur should furnish the Charité of Tulle with wool,
soap, and coal, and in return the establishment would re-
deliver the wool carded and spun. The profit was divided
between the entrepreneur and the hospital. Even in Paris,
several attempts were made to transform the buildings of
the Hépital Général into factories. If we can believe the
author of an anonymous mézmoire that appeared in 1790, at
La Pitié “all the varieties of manufacture that could be
offered to the capital” were attempted, finally, “in a kind
of despair, a manufacture was undertaken of 2 sort of lac-
ing found to be the least costly.” Elsewhere, such efforts
were scarcely more fruitful. Numerous efforts were made
at Bicétre; manufacture of thread and rope, mirror polish-
ing, and especially the famous “great well.” An attempt
‘was even made, in 1781, to substitute teams of prisoners for
the horses that brought up the water, in relay from five in
the morning to eight at night: “What reason could have

(53)

 
 MADNESS & CIVILIZATION

determined this strange occupation? Was it that of econ-
omy or simply the necessity of busying the prisoners? If
the latter, would it not have been better to occupy them
with work more useful both for them and for the hospital?
If for reasons of economy, we are a long way from finding
any.”* During the entire eighteenth century, the economic
significance Colbert wanted to give the Hépital Général
continued to recede; that center of forced labor would be-
come a place of privileged idleness. “What is the source of
the disorders at Bicétre?” the men of the Revolution were
again to ask, And they would supply the answer that had
already been given in the seventeenth century: “It is idle-
ness. What is the means of remedying it? Work.”

The classical age used confinement in an equivocal man-
ner, making it play a double role: to reabsorb unemploy-
ment, or at least eliminate its most visible social effects, and
to control costs when they seemed likely to become too
high; to act alternately on the manpower market and on
the cost of production. As it turned out, it does not seem
that the houses of confinement were able to play effectively
the double role that was expected of them. If they absorbed
the unemployed, it was mostly to mask their poverty, and
to avoid the social or political disadvantages of agitation;
but at the very moment the unemployed were herded into
forced-labor shops, unemployment increased in neighbor-
ing regions or in similar areas. As for the effect on produc-
tion costs, it could only be artificial, the market price of
such products being disproportionate to the cost of manu-
facture, calculated according to the expenses occasioned by
confinement itself.

Measured by their functional value alone, the creation of
the houses of confinement can be regarded as a failure.
Their disappearance throughout Europe, at the beginning
of the nineteenth century, as receiving centers for the in-

INTRODUCTION

Erasmus’s Praise of Folly, demonstrated how fascinating
imagination and some of its vagaries were to the thinkers of
that day. The French Revolution, Pinel, and Tuke empha-
sized political, legal, medical, or religious aspects of mad-
ness; and today, our so-called objective medical approach,
in spite of the benefits that it has brought to the mentally
ill, continues to look at only one side of the picture. Folly is
so human that it has common roots with poetry and trag-
edy; it is revealed as much in the insane asylum as in the
writings of a Cervantes or a Shakespeare, or in the deep
psychological insights and cries of revolt of a Nietzsche.
Correctly or incorrectly, the author feels that Freud’s
death instinct also stems from the tragic elements which led
men of all epochs to worship, laugh at, and dread folly
simultaneously, Fascinating as Renaissance men found it—
they painted it, praised it, sang about it—it also heralded
for them death of the body by picturing death of the mind.

Nothing is more illuminating than to follow with M.
Foucault the many threads which are woven in this com-
plex book, whether it speaks of changing symptoms, com-
mitment procedures, or treatment. For example: he sees a
definite connection between some of the attirudes toward
madness and the disappearance, between 1200 and 1400, of
leprosy. In the middle of the twelfth century, France had
more than 2,000 leprosariums, and England and Scot-
land 220 for a population of a million and a half
people. As leprosy vanished, in part because of segregation,
a void was created and the moral values attached to the
leper had to find another scapegoat. Mental illness and un-
reason attracted that stigma to themselves, but even this
was neither complete, simple, nor immediate.

Renaissance men developed a delightful, yet horrible
way of dealing with their mad denizens: they were put on
a ship and entrusted to mariners because folly, water, and
sea, as everyone then “knew,” had an affinity for each

(vi)
 The Great Confinement

digent and prisons of poverty, was to sanction their ulti-
mate failure: a transitory and ineffectual remedy, a social
precaution clumsily formulated by a nascent industrializa-
tion, And yet, in this very failure, the classical period con-
ducted an irreducible experiment. What appears to us to-
day as a clumsy dialectic of production and prices then
possessed its real meaning as a certain ethical consciousness
of labor, in which the difficulties of the economic mecha-
nisms lost their urgency in favor of an affirmation of value.

In this first phase of the industrial world, labor did not
seem linked to the problems it was to provoke; it was re-
garded, on the contrary, as a general solution, an infallible
panacea, a remedy to all forms of poverty. Labor and pov-
erty were located in a simple opposition, in inverse propor-
tion to each other. As for that power, its special character-
istic, of abolishing poverty, labor--according to the classical
interpretation—possessed it not so much by its produc-
tive capacity as by a certain force of moral enchantment.
Labor’s effectiveness was acknowledged because it was
based on an ethical transcendence. Since the Fall, man had
accepted labor as a penance and for its power to work
redemption. It was not a law of nature which forced man
to work, but the effect of a curse. The earth was innocent
of that sterility in which it would slumber if man remained
idle: “The land had not sinned, and if it is accursed, it is by
the labor of the fallen man who cultivates it; from it no
fruit is won, particularly the most necessary fruit, save by
force and continual labor.”*

The obligation to work was not linked to any confidence
in nature; and it was not even through an obscure loyalty
that the land would reward man’s labor. The theme was
constant among Catholic thinkers, as among the Protes-
tants, that labor does not bear its own fruits. Produce and
wealth were not found at the term of a dialectic of labor
and nature. Here is Calvin’s admonition: “Nor do we be-

(s5)

 
 Mavness & CIVILIZATION

lieve, according as men will be vigilant and skillful, accord-
ing as they will have done their duty well, that they can
make their land fertile; it is the benediction of God which
governs all things.” And this danger of a labor which
would remain sterile if God did not intervene in His infi-
nite mercy is acknowledged in turn by Bossiet: “At each
moment, the hope of the harvest and the unique fruit of all
our labors may escape us; we are at the mercy of the incon-
stant heavens that bring down rain upon the tender ears.”
This precarious labor to which nature is never obliged
to respond—save by the special will of God—is none-
theless obligatory in all strictness: not on the level of
natural syntheses, but on the level of moral syntheses. The
poor man who, without consenting to “torment” the land,
waits until God comes to his aid, since He has promised to
feed the birds of the sky, would be disobeying the great
law of Scripture: “Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy
God.” Does not reluctance to work mean “trying beyond
measure the power of God,” as Calvin says? It is seeking to
constrain the miracle,” whereas the miracle is granted daily
to man as the gratuitous reward of his labor. If it is true
that labor is not inscribed among the laws of nature, it is
enveloped in the order of the fallen world. This is why
idleness is rebellion—the worst form of all, in a sense: it
waits for nature to be generous as in the innocence of
Eden, and seeks to constrain a Goodness to which man
cannot lay claim since Adam. Pride was the sin of man
before the Fall; but the sin of idleness is the supreme pride
of man once he has fallen, the absurd pride of poverty. In
our world, where the land is no longer fertile except in
thistles and weeds, idleness is the fault par excellence. In the
Middle Ages, the great sin, radix malorum omnium, was
pride, Superbia. According to Johan Huizinga, there was a
time, at the dawn of the Renaissance, when the supreme sin
assumed the aspect of Avarice, Dante’s cicca cupidigia. All

(56)

 
 The Great Confinement

the seventeenth-century texts, on the contrary, announced
the infernal triumph of Sloth: it was sloth which Jed the
round of the vices and swept them on. Let us not forget
that according to the edict of its creation, the Hépital Gé-
néral must prevent “mendicancy and idleness as sources of
all disorder.” Louis Bourdaloue echoes these condemna-
tions of sloth, the wretched pride of fallen man: “What,
then, is the disorder of an idle life? It is, replies Saint Am-
brose, in its true meaning a second rebellion of the creature
against God.” Labor in the houses of confinement thus as-
sumed its ethical meaning: since sloth had become the
absolute form of rebellion, the idle would be forced to
work, in the endless leisure of a labor without utilicy or
profit.

It was in a certain experience of labor that the indissoci-
ably economic and moral demand for confinement was
formulated. Between labor and idleness in the classical world
ran a line of demarcation that replaced the exclusion of
leprosy. The asylum was substituted for the lazar house, in
the geography of haunted places as in the landscape of the
moral universe. The old rites of excommunication were re-
vived, but in the world of production and commerce. Ic
was in these places of doomed and despised idleness, in
this space invented by a society which had derived an eth-
ical transcendence from the law of work, that madness
would appear and soon expand until it had annexed them.
A day was to come when it could possess these sterile
reaches of idleness by a sort of very old and very dim nght
of inheritance. The nineteenth century would consent,
would even insist that to the mad and to them alone be
transferred these lands on which, a hundred and fifty years’
before, men had sought to pen the poor, the vagabond, the
unemployed.

It is not immaterial that madmen were included in the
proscription of idleness. From its origin, they would have

(57)

 
 MavNESS & CIVILIZATION

their place beside the poor, deserving or not, and the idle,
voluntary or not. Like them, they would be subject to the
rules of forced labor. More than once, in fact, they figured
in their singular fashion within this uniform constraint. In
the workshops in which they were interned, they distin-
guished themselves by their inability to work and to follow
the rhythms of collective life. The necessity, discovered in
the eighteenth century, to provide a special regime for the
insane, and the great crisis of confinement that shortly pre-
ceded the Revolution, are linked to the experience of mad~-
ness available in the universal necessity of labor. Men did
not wait until the seventeenth century to “shut up” the
mad, but it was in this period that they began to “confine”
or “intern” them, along with an entire population with
whom their kinship was recognized. Until the Renaissance,
the sensibility to madness was linked to the presence of
imaginary transcendences. In the classical age, for the first
time, madness was perceived through a condemnation of
idleness and in a social immanence guaranteed by the com-
munity of labor. This community acquired an ethical
power of segregation, which permitted it to eject, as into
another world, all forms of social uselessness. It was in this
other world, encircled by the sacred powers of labor, that
madness would assume the status we now attribute to ic. If
there is, in classical madness, something which refers else-
where, and to other things, it is no longer because the mad-
man comes from the world of the irrational and bears its
stigmata; rather, it is because he crosses the frontiers of
bourgeois order of his own accord, and alienates himself
outside the sacred limits of its ethic,

In fact, the relation between the practice of confinement
and the insistence on work is not defined by economic con-
ditions; far from it. A moral perception sustains and ani-
mates it. When the Board of Trade published its report on
the poor in which it proposed the means “to render them

(58)

 
 The Great Confinement

useful to the public,” it was made quite clear that the ori-
gin of poverty was neither scarcity of commodities nor un-
employment, but “the weakening of discipline and the
relaxation of morals.” The edict of 1657, too, was full of
moral denunciations and strange threats, “The libertinage
of beggars has risen to excess because of an unfortunate
tolerance of crimes of all sorts, which attract the curse of
God upon the State when they remain unpunished.” This
“fibertinage” is not the kind that can be defined in relation
to the great law of work, but a moral libertinage: ‘Experi-
ence having taught those persons who are employed in
charitable occupations that many among them of either sex
live together without marriage, that many of their children
are unbaptized, and that almost all of them live in ignorance
of religion, disdaining the sacraments, and continually prac-
ticing all sorts of vice.” Hence the Hépital does not have
the appearance of a mere refuge for those whom age, in-
firmity, or sickness keep from working; it will have not
only the aspect of a forced labor camp, but also that of a
moral institution responsible for punishing, for correcting a
certain moral “abeyance” which does not merit the tribunal
of men, but cannot be corrected by the severity of penance
alone, The Hépital Général has an ethical status. It is this
moral charge which invests its directors, and they are
granted every judicial apparatus and means of repression:
“They have power of authority, of direction, of admin-
istration, of commerce, of police, of jurisdiction, of correc-
tion and punishment”; and to accomplish this task “stakes,
irons, prisons, and dungeons” are put at their disposal.

And it is in this context that the obligation to work as-
sumes its meaning as both ethical exercise and moral guar-
antee. It will serve as askesis, as punishment, as symptom of
a certain disposition of the heart. The prisoner who could
and who would work would be released, not so much be-
cause he was again useful to society, but because he had

(59)

 

 
  

Mavwess & CIVILIZATION

again subscribed to the great ethical pact of human exist-
ence. In April 1684, a decree created within the Hépital a
section for boys and girls under twenty-five; it specified
that work must occupy the greater part of the day, and
must be accompanied by “the reading of pious books.” But
the ruling defines the purely repressive nature of this work,
beyond any concern for production: “They will be made
to work as long and as hard as their strengths and situations
will permit.” It is then, bur only then, that they can be
taught an occupation “fitting their sex and inclination,”
insofar as the measure of their zeal in the first activities
makes it possible to “judge that they desire to reform.”
Finally, every fault “will be punished by reduction of
gruel, by increase of work, by imprisonment and other
punishments customary in the said hospitals, as the direc~
tors shall see fit.” Ir is enough to read the “general regula~
tions for daily life in the House of Saint-Louis de la Salpétri-
ére” to understand that the very requirement of labor was
instituted as an exercise in moral reform and constraint,
which reveals, if not the ultimate meaning, at least the es-
sential justification of confinement.

An important phenomenon, this invention of 2 site of
constraint, where morality castigates by means of admin-
istrative enforcement. For the first time, institutions of
morality are established in which an astonishing synthesis
of moral obligation and civil law is effected, The law of
nations will no longer countenance the disorder of hearts. To
be sure, this is not the first time in European culture that
moral error, even in its most private form, has assumed the
aspect of a transgression against the written or unwritten
laws of the community. But in this great confinement of
the classical age, the essential thing--and the new event—is
that men were confined in cities of pure morality, where
the law that should reign in all hearts was to be applied
without compromise, without concession, in the rigorous

(f0)
 The Great Confinement

forms of physical constraint. Morality permitted itself to be
administered like trade or economy.

Thus we see inscribed in the institutions of absolute
monarchy-~in the very ones that long remained the symbol
of its arbitrary power—the great bourgeois, and soon re~
publican, idea that virtue, too, is-an affair of state, that
decrees can be published to make it flourish, that an author-
ity can be established to make sure it is respected. The walls
of confinement actually enclose the negative of that moral
city of which the bourgeois conscience began to dream in
the seventeenth century; a moral city for those who
sought, from the start, to avoid it, a city where right reigns
only by virtue of a force without appeal—a sort of sover-
eignty of good, in which intimidation alone prevails and the
only recompense of virtue (to this degree its own reward)
is to escape punishment. In the shadows of the bourgecis
city is born this strange republic of the good which is im-
posed by force on all those suspected of belonging to evil.
This is the underside of the bourgeoisie’s great dream and
great preoccupation in the classical age: the laws of the
State and the laws of the heart at last identical. “Let our
politicians leave off their calculations . . . let them learn
once and for alt that everything can be had for money,
except morals and citizens.”°

Is this not the dream that seems to have haunted the
founders of the house of confinement in Hamburg? One of
the directors is to see that “all in the house are properly
instructed as to religious and moral duties... . The
schoolmaster must instruct the children in religion, and en-
courage them, at proper times, to learn and repeat portions
of Scripture. He must also teach them reading, writing and
accounts, and a decent behaviour to those that visit the
house. He must take care that they attend divine service,
and are orderly at it.”!° In England, the workhouse regu-
lations devote much space to the surveillance of morals and

(67)

 
  

Mavness & CIVILIZATION

to religious education. Thus for the house in Plymouth, 2
schoolmaster is to be appointed who will fulfill the triple
requirement of being “pious, sober, and discreet.” Every
morning and evening, at the prescribed hour, it will be his
task to preside at prayers; every Saturday afternoon and on
holidays, he will address the inmates, exhorting and in-
structing them in “the fundamental parts of the Protestant
religion, according to the doctrine of the Church of Eng-
land.” Hamburg or Plymouth, Zuchthausern and work-
houses—throughout Protestant Europe, fortresses of moral
order were constructed, in which were taught religion and
whatever was necessary to the peace of the State.

In Catholic countries, the goal is the same but the reli-
gious imprint is a little more marked, as the work of Saint
Vincent de Paul bears witness. “The principal end for
which such persons have been removed here, out of the
storms of the great world, and introduced into this solitude
as pensioners, is entirely to keep them from the slavery of
sin, from being eternally damned, and to give them means
to rejoice in a perfect contentment in this world and in the
next; they will do all they can to worship, in this world,
Divine Providence. . . . Experience convinces us only too
unhappily that the source of the misrule triumphant today
among the young lies entirely in the lack of instruction and
of obedience in spiritual matters, since they much prefer to
follow their evil inclinations than the holy inspiration of
God and the charitable advice of their parents.”"* There-
fore the pensioners must be delivered from a world which,
for their weakness, is only an invitation to sin, must be
recalled to a solitude where they will have as companions
only their “guardian angels” incarnate in the daily presence
of their warders: these latter, in fact, “render them the
same good offices that their guardian angels perform for
them invisibly: namely, instruct them, console them, and
procure their salvation.” In the houses of La Chariré, the

(62)
 The Great Confinement

greatest attention was paid to this ordering of life and con-
science, which throughout the eighteenth century would
‘more and more clearly appear as the raison d’étre of con-
finement. In 1765, new regulations were established for the
Charité of Chateau-Thierry; it was made quite clear that
“the Prior will visit all the prisoners at least once a week,
one after the other, and separately, to console them, to
exhort them to better conduct, and to assure himself that
they are treated as they should be; the subordinate officer
will do this every day.”

All these prisons of moral order might have borne the
motto which Howard could still read on the one in Mainz:
“If wild beasts can be broken to the yoke, it must not be
despaired of correcting the man who has strayed.” For the
Catholic Church, as in the Protestant countries, confine-
ment represents, in the form of an authoritarian model, the
myth of social happiness: a police whose order will be en-
tirely transparent to the principles of religion, and a reli-
gion whose requirements will be satisfied, without restric-
tions, by the regulations of the police and the constraints
with which it can be armed. There is, in these institutions,
an attempt of a kind to demonstrate that order may be
adequate to virtue. In this sense, “confinement” conceals
both a metaphysics of government and a politics of reli-
gion; it is sicuated, as an effort of tyrannical synthesis, in
the vast space separating the garden of God and the cities
which men, driven from paradise, have built with their
own hands. The house of confinement in the classical age
constitutes the densest symbol of that “police” which con-
ceived of itself as the civil equivalent of religion for the
edification of a perfect city.

Confinement was an institutional creation peculiar to the
seventeenth century. It acquired from the first an impor-
tance that left it no rapport with imprisonment as practiced

(63)

 

 
  

MADNESS & CIVILIZATION

in the Middle Ages. As an economic measure and a social
precaution, it had the value of inventiveness. But in the
history of unreason, it marked a decisive event: the mo-
ment when madness was perceived on the social horizon of
poverty, of incapacity for work, of inability to integrate
with the group; the moment when madness began to rank
among the problems of the city. The new meanings as-
signed to poverty, the importance given to the obligation
to work, and all the ethical values that are linked to labor,
ultimately determined the experience of madness and in-
flected its course.

A sensibility was born which had drawn a line and laid a
cornerstone, and which chose—only to banish. The con-
crete space of classical society reserved a neutral region, a
blank page where the real life of the city was suspended;
here, order no longer freely confronted disorder, reason no
longer tried to make its own way among all that might
evade or seek to deny it. Here reason reigned in the pure
state, in a triumph arranged for it in advance over a fren-
zied unreason. Madness was thus torn from that imaginary
freedom which still allowed it to flourish on the Renais-
sance horizon. Not so long ago, it had floundered about in
broad daylight; in King Lear, in Don Quixote. But in less
than a half-century, it had been sequestered and, in the
fortress of confinement, bound to Reason, to the rules of
morality and to their monotonous nights.

other. Thus, “Ships of Fools” crisscrossed the seas and
canals of Europe with their comic and pathetic cargo of
souls. Some of them found pleasure and even a cure in the
changing surroundings, in the isolation of being cast off,
while others withdrew further, became worse, or died
alone and away from their families. The cities and villages
which had thus rid themselves of their crazed and crazy,
could now take pleasure in watching the exciting sideshow
when a ship full of foreign lunatics would dock at their
harbors. The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw
much social unrest and economic depression, which they
tried to solve by imprisoning the indigents with the crimi-
nals and forcing them to work. The demented fitted quite
naturally between those two extremes of social maladjust-
ment and iniquity.

A nice and hallowed tradition has labeled Tuke and Pinel
as the saviors of the mentally ill, but the truth of the matter
is not so simple. Many others had treated them with kind-
ness, pleading that they belonged first and foremost with
their families, and for at least two hundred years before
the 1780s, legislation had been considered or passed to
segregate criminals and indigents from fools. But this legis-
lation was prompted, as often as not, by a desire to protect
the poor, the criminal, the man imprisoned for debts, and
the juvenile delinquent from the frightening bestiality of
the madman. As the madman had replaced the leper, the

. mentally ill person was now a subhuman and beastly scape-
goat; hence the need to protect others, While the Quaker
Tuke applied his religious principles, first to demented
“friends” and later to foes also, partly to convert them, the
great Pinel was not sure at times that he was dealing with
sick people; he often marveled ac their unbelievable endur-
ance of physical hardship, and often cited the ability of

. schizophrenic women to sleep naked in subfreezing tem-
peratures without suffering any ill effects. Were not these

THE INSANE

From the creation of the Hépital Général, from the open-
ing, in Germany and in England, of the first houses of
correction, and until the end of the eighteenth century, the
age of reason confined. It confined the debauched, spend~
thrift fathers, prodigal sons, blasphemers, men who “seek to
undo themselves,” libertines. And through these parallels,
these strange complicities, the age sketched the profile of its
own experience of wnreason.

But in each of these cities, we find an entire population
of madness as well. One-tenth of all the arrests made in
Paris for the Hépital Général concern “the insane,” “de-
mented” men, individuals of “wandering mind,” and “per-
sons who have become completely mad.” Between these
and the others, no sign of a differentiation. Judging from
the registries, the same sensibility appears to collect them,
the same gestures to set them apart. We leave it to medical

_archaeology to determine whether or not a man was sick,
criminal, or insane who was admitted to the hospital for

(65)

 
 Mavwness & CIVILIZATION

”

“derangement of morals,” or because he had “mistreated
his wife” and tried several times to kill himself.

Yer it must not be forgotten that the “insane” had as
such a particular place in the world of confinement. Their
status was not merely that of prisoners. In the general
sensibility to unreason, there appeared to be a special
modulation which concerned madness proper, and was ad-
dressed to those called, without exact semantic distinction,
insane, alienated, deranged, demented, extravagant.

This particular form of sensibility traces the features
proper to madness in the world of unreason. It is primarily
concerned with scandal, In its most general form, confine-
ment is explained, or at least justified, by the desire to avoid
scandal. It even signifies thereby an important change in
the consciousness of evil. The Renaissance had freely al-
lowed the forms of unreason to come out into the light of
day; public outrage gave evil the powers of example and
redemption. Gilles de Rais, accused, in the fifteenth cen-
tury, of having been and of being “a heretic, an apostate, a
sorcerer, a sodomite, an invoker of evil spirits, a soothsayer,
a slayer of innocents, an idolater, working evil by deviation
from the faith,” ended by himself admitting to crimes
“sufficient to cause the deaths of ten thousand persons” in
extrajudiciary confession; he repeated his avowal in Latin
before the tribunal; then he asked, of his own accord, that
“the said confession should be published in the vulgar
tongue and exhibited to each and every one of those pres-
ent, the majority of whom knew no Latin, the publication
and confession to his shame of the said offenses by him
committed, in order the more easily to obtain the remission
of sins, and the mercy of God for the pardon of the sins by
him committed.” Ar the trial, the same confession was re-
quired before those assembled: he “was told by the Presid-
ing Judge that he should state his case fully, and the shame
that he would gain thereby would serve to lessen the pun-

(66)

 

 
  

The Insane

ishment he would suffer hereafter.” Until the seventeenth
century, evil in all its most violent and most inhuman forms
could not be dealt with and punished unless ic was brought
into the open. The light in which confession was made and
punishment executed could alone balance the darkness
from which evil issued. In order to pass through all the
stages of its fulfillment, evil must necessarily incur public
avowal and manifestation before reaching the conclusion
which suppresses it.

Confinement, on the contrary, betrays a form of con-
science to which the inhuman can suggest only shame.
There are aspects of evil that have such a power of conta-
gion, such a force of scandal that any publicicy multiplies
them infinitely. Only oblivion can suppress them. In a case
of poisoning, Pontchartrain orders not a public trial but the
secrecy of an asylum: “As the facts of the case concerned 2
good part of Paris, the King did not believe that so many
people should be brought to trial, many of whom had com-
mitted crimes unawares, and others only by the ease of
doing so; His Majesty so determined the more readily in-
sofar as he is persuaded that there are certain crimes which
must absolutely be thrust into oblivion.”* Beyond the dan-
gers of example, the honor of families and that of religion
sufficed to recommend a subject for a house of confine-
ment, Apropos of a priest who was to be sent to Saint-
Lazare: “Hence a priest such as this cannot be hidden away
with too much care for the honor of religion and that of
the priesthood.”? Even late in the eighteenth century,
Malesherbes would defend confinement as a right of fami-
lies seeking to escape dishonor. “That which is called a base
action is placed in the rank of those which public order
does not permit us to tolerate. . . . It seems that the honor
of a family requires the disappearance from society of the
individual who by vile and abject habits shames his rela-
tives.” Inversely, liberation is in order when the danger of

(67)

 
 Mavness & CIVILIZATION

scandal is past and the honor of families or of the Church
can no longer be sullied. The Abbé Bargedé had been
confined for a long time; never, despite his requests, had his —
release been authorized; but now old age and infirmity had
made scandal impossible. ‘And besides, his paralysis per-
sists,” writes d’Argenson, “he can neither write nor sign his
name; I think that there would be justice and charity in
setting him free.” All those forms of evil that border on
unreason must be thrust into secrecy. Classicism felt a
shame in the presence of the inhuman that the Renaissance
had never experienced.

Yet there is one exception in this consignment to secrecy:
that which is made for madmen.* It was doubtless a very
old custom of the Middle Ages to display the insane. In
certain of the Narrtiirmer in Germany, barred windows
had been installed which permitted those outside to observe
the madmen chained within. They thus constituted a spec-
tacle at the city gates. The strange fact is that this custom
did not disappear once the doors of the asylums closed, but
that on the contrary it then developed, assuming in Paris
and London almost an institutional character. As late as
1815, if a report presented in the House of Commons is to
be believed, the hospital of Bethlehem exhibited lunatics for
a penny, every Sunday. Now the annual revenue from
these exhibitions amounted to almost four hundred pounds;
which suggests the astonishingly high number of 96,000
visits a year.* In France, the excursion to Bicétre and the
display of the insane remained until the Revolution one of
the Sunday distractions for the Left Bank bourgeoisie.
Mirabeau reports in his Observations d’un voyageur anglais
that the madmen at Bicétre were shown “like curious ani-
mails, to the first simpleton willing to pay a coin.” One
went to see the keeper display the madmen the way the
trainer at the Fair of Saint-Germain put the monkeys
through their tricks.’ Certain attendants were well known

(68)

 
     

 
   

The Insane

for their ability to make the mad perform dances and acro-
batics, with 2 few flicks of the whip. The only extenuation
to be found at the end of the eighteenth century was that
the mad were allowed to exhibit the mad, as if it were the
responsibility of madness to testify to its own nature. “Let
us not slander human nature. The English traveler is right
to regard the office of exhibiting madmen as beyond the
most hardened humanity. We have already said so. But all
dilemmas afford a remedy. It is the madmen themselves
who are entrusted in their lucid intervals with displaying
their companions, who, in their turn, return the favor.
Thus the keepers of these unfortunate creatures enjoy the
profits that the spectacle affords, without indulging in a
heartlessness to which, no doubt, they could never de-
scend.”® Here is madness elevated to spectacle above the
silence of the asylums, and becoming a public scandal for
the general delight. Unreason was hidden in the silence of
the houses of confinement, but madness continued to be
present on the stage of the world—with more commotion
than ever. It would soon reach, under the Empire, a point
that had never been attained in the Middle Ages and the
Renaissance; the strange Brotherhood of the Blue Ship had
once given performances in which madness was mimed;
now it was madness itself, madness in flesh and blood,
which put on the show. Early in the nineteenth century,
Coulmier, the director of Charenton, had organized those
famous performances in which madmen sometimes played
the roles of actors, sometimes those of watched spectators.
“The insane who attended these theatricals were the object
of the attention and curiosity of a frivolous, irresponsible,
and often vicious public. The bizarre attitudes of these un-
fortunates and their condition provoked the mocking
laughter and the insulting pity of the spectators.”’ Madness
became pure spectacle, im a world over which Sade ex-
tended his sovereignty and which was offered as a diversion

(69)

 
  

Madness & CIVILIZATION

to the good conscience of a reason sure of itself. Until the
beginning of the nineteenth century, and to the indignation
of Royer-Collard, madmen remained monsters—that is,
etymologically, beings or things to be shown.

Confinement hid away unreason, and betrayed the shame
it aroused; but it explicitly drew attention to madness, -
pointed to it. If, in the case of unreason, the chief intention
‘was to avoid scandal, in the case of madness that intention
was to organize it. A strange contradiction: the classical age
enveloped madness in a total experience of unreason; it re-
absorbed its particular forms, which the Middle Ages and
the Renaissance had clearly individualized into a general
apprehension in which madness consorted indiscriminately
with all the forms of unreason. But at the same time it
assigned to this same madness a special sign: not that of
sickness, but that of glorified scandal. Yet there is nothing
in common between this organized exhibition of madness in
the eighteenth century and the freedom with which it came
to light during the Renaissance. In the Renaissance, mad-
ness was present everywhere and mingled with every ex-
perience by its images or its dangers. During the classical
period, madness was shown, but on the other side of bars; if
present, it was at a distance, under the eyes of 2 reason that
no longer felt any relation to it and that would not com-
promise itself by too close a resemblance. Madness had be-
come a thing to look at: no longer a monster inside oneself,
but an animal with strange mechanisms, a bestiality from
which man had long since been suppressed. “I can easily
conceive of a man without hands, feet, head (for it is only
experience which teaches us chat the head is more necessary
than the feet), But I cannot conceive of man without
thought; that would be a stone or a brute.”*

In his Report on the Care of the Insane Desportes de-
scribes the cells of Bicétre as they were at the end of the
eighteenth century: “The unfortunate whose entire furni-

(79)
 The Insane

ture consisted of this straw pallet, lying with his head, feet,
and body pressed against the wall, could not enjoy sleep
without being soaked by the water that trickled from that
mass of stone.” As for the cells of La Salpétriére, what
made “the place more miserable and often more fatal, was
that in winter, when the waters of the Seine rose, those
cells situated at the level of the sewers became not only
more unhealthy, but worse still, 2 refuge for a swarm of
huge rats, which during the night attacked the unfortu-
nates confined there and bit them wherever they could
reach them; madwomen have been found with feet, hands,
and faces torn by bites which are often dangerous and from
which several have died.” But these were the dungeons and
cells long reserved for the most dangerous and most violent
of the insane. If they were calmer, and if no one had any-
thing to fear from them, they were crammed into wards of
varying size. One of Samuel Tuke’s most active disciples,
Godfrey Higgins, had obtained the right, which cost him
twenty pounds, to visit the asylum of York as a volunteer
inspector. In the course of a visit, he discovered a door that
had been carefully concealed and found behind it 2 room,
not eight feet on a side, which thirteen women occupied
during the night; by day, they lived in a room scarcely
larger,

On the other hand, when the insane were particularly
dangerous, they were constrained by a system which was
doubtless not of a punitive nature, but simply intended to
fix within narrow limits the physical locus of a raging
frenzy. Sufferers were generally chained to the walls and to
the beds. At Bethlehem, violent madwomen were chained
by the ankles to the wall of a long gallery; their only gar-
ment was a homespun dress. At another hospital, in Bethnal
Green, 2 woman subject to violent seizures was placed in a
pigsty, feet and fists bound; when the crisis had passed she
was tied to her bed, covered only by a blanket; when she

(77)

 
 Mavness & CivILIzATION

‘was allowed to take a few steps, an iron bar was placed
between her legs, attached by rings to her ankles and by a
short chain to handcuffs. Samuel Tuke, in his Report on
the Condition of the Indigent Insane, gives the details of a
complicated system devised at Bethlehem to control a re-
putedly dangerous madman: he was attached by a long
chain that ran over the wall and thus permitted the atten-
dant to lead him about, to keep him on a leash, so to speak,
from outside; around his neck had been placed an iron ring,
which was attached by a short chain to another ring; this
latter slid the length of a vertical iron bar fastened to the
floor and ceiling of the cell. When reforms began to be
instituted at Bethlehem, a man was found who had lived in
this cell, attached in this fashion, for twelve years.

When practices reach this degree of violent intensity, it
becomes clear that they are no longer inspired by the desire
to punish nor by the duty to correct. The notion of a
“resipiscence” is entirely foreign to this regime. But there
‘was a certain image of animality that haunted the hospitals
of the period. Madness borrowed its face from the mask of
the beast. Those chained to the cell walls were no longer
men whose minds had wandered, but beasts preyed upon
by a natural frenzy: as if madness, at its extreme point,
freed from that moral unreason in which its most attenu-
ated forms are enclosed, managed to rejoin, by a paroxysm
of strength, the immediate violence of animality. This
model of animality prevailed in the asylums and gave them
their cagelike aspect, their look of the menagerie. Coguel
describes La Salpétrigre at the end of the eighteenth cen-
tury: “Madwomen seized with fits of violence are chained
like dogs at their cell doors, and separated from keepers and
visitors alike by a long corridor protected by an iron grille;
through this grille is passed their food and the straw on
which they sleep; by means of rakes, part of the filch that
surrounds them is cleaned out.” At the hospital of Nantes,

(72)

 
 The Insane

the menagerie appears to consist of individual cages for
wild beasts. Never had Esquirol seen “such an extravagance
of locks, of bolts, of iron bars to shut the doors of the
cells. . . . Tiny openings pierced next to the doors were
fitted with iron bars and shutters. Quite close to this open-
ing hung a chain fastened to the wall and bearing at its end
a cast-iron receptacle, somewhat resembling a wooden
shoe, in which food was placed and passed through the bars
of these openings.” When Frangois-Emmanuel Fodéré ar-
rived at the hospital of Strasbourg in 1814, he found a kind
of human stable, constructed with great care and skill: “for
troublesome madmen and those who dirtied themselves, 2
kind of cage, or wooden closet, which could at the most
contain one man of middie height, had been devised at the
ends of the great wards.” These cages had gratings for
floors, and did not rest on the ground but were raised about
fifteen centimeters. Over these gratings was thrown a little
straw “upon which the madman lay, naked or nearly so,
took his meals, and deposited his excrement.”

This, to be sure, is a whole security system against the
violence of the insane and the explosion of their fury. Such
outbursts are regarded chiefly as a social danger. But what
is most important is that it is conceived in terms of an
animal freedom, The negative fact that “the madman is not
treated like a human being” has a very positive content:
this inhuman indifference actually has an obsessional value:
it is rooted in the old fears which since antiquity, and espe-
cially since the Middle Ages, have given the animal world
its familiar strangeness, its menacing marvels, its entire
weight of dumb anxiety. Yet this animal fear which ac-
companies, with all its imaginary landscape, the perception
of madness, no longer has the same meaning it had two or
three centuries earlier: animal metamorphosis is no longer
the visible sign of infernal powers, nor the result of a dia-
bolic alchemy of unreason. The animal in man no longer

(73)

 
 Mavness & CivILIZATION

has any value as the sign of a Beyond; it has become his
madness, without relation to anything but itself: his mad-
ness in the state of nature. The animality that rages in
madness dispossesses man of what is specifically human in
him; not in order to deliver him over to other powers, but
simply to establish him at the zero degree of his own na-
ture. For classicism, madness in its ultimate form is man in
immediate relation to his animality, without other refer-
ence, without any recourse.

The day would come when from an evolutionary per-
spective this presence of animality in madness would be
considered as the sign—indeed, as the very essence—of
disease. In the classical period, on the contrary, it mani-
fested the very fact that the madman was not a sick man,
Animality, in fact, protected the lunatic from whatever
might be fragile, precarious, or sickly in man. The animal _
solidity of madness, and that density it borrows from the
blind world of beasts, inured the madman to hunger, heat,
cold, pain. It was common knowledge until the end of the
eighteenth century that the insane could support the miser-
ies of existence indefinitely. There was no need to protect
them; they had no need to be covered or warmed. When,
in 1811, Samuel Tuke visited a workhouse in the Southern
Counties, he saw cells where the daylight passed through
little barred windows that had been cut in the doors. All
the women were entirely naked. Now “the temperature
was extremely rigorous, and the evening of the day before,
the thermometer had indicated a cold of 18 degrees. One
of these unfortunate women was lying on a little straw,
without covering.” This ability of the insane to endure, like
animals, the worst inclemencies was stil] a medical dogma
for Pinel; he would always admire “the constancy and the
ease with which certain of the insane of both sexes bear the
most rigorous and prolonged cold. In the month of Ni-
vése of the Year III, on certain days when the ther-

INTRODUCTION

people more healthy, more resistant than ordinary human
beings? Didn’t they have too much animal spirit in them?
Naturally, it is impossible to discuss a book as complex as
Madness and Civilization without oversimplifying and do-
ing it an injustice. It is a tale of nuances, relative values, and
delicate shadings. Yet, it is an impressive monument: in a
dispassionate manner it marshals overwhelming evidence to
dispel more effectively than many previous attempts the
myth of mental illness, and re-establishes folly and un-
reason in their rightful place as complex, human—too hu-
man—phenomena. The roots and symptoms of folly are
being looked for today in psychology, medicine, and soci-
ology, but they were and still are as present and important
in art,* religion, ethics, and epistemology. Madness is really
a manifestation of the “soul,” 2 variable concept which
from antiquity to the twentieth century covered approxi-
mately what came to be known, after Freud, as the un-
conscious part of the human mind.t Only time will tell how
much better students of the psyche can look at the future,
after reading this sobering re-creation of yesteryear’s mad~
ness and the ineffective attempts of humanity to treat it by
amputation, projections, prejudices, and segregation.

* My only quarrel] with the book is the lack of emphasis on the humor-
istic elements in psychoses and neuroses: i.e., the patient laughs at him-
self, or laughs at the world through his illness.

+ The fear and dread of madness is as real a factor in social and medical
attitudes or measures as anxiety, symptoms, and resistance in coping with
impulses from the individual unconscious; even though the author does
not explicitly compare madness with the unconscious, he equates mad-
ness and dream activity so that the inference is clear enough.

mometer indicated 10, 11, and as many as 16 degrees below
freezing, a madman in the hospital of Bicétre could not
endure his wool blanket, and remained sitting on the icy
floor of his cell. In the morning, one no sooner opened his
door than he ran in his shirt into the inner court, taking
ice and snow by the fistful, applying it to his breast and
letting it melt with a sort of delectation.” Madness, insofar
as it partook of animal ferocity, preserved man from the
dangers of disease; it afforded him an invulnerability, simi-
lar to that which nature, in its foresight, had provided for.
animals. Curiously, the disturbance of his reason restored
the madman to the immediate kindness of nature by a re-
turn to animality.

This is why, at this extreme point, madness was less than
ever linked to medicine; nor could it be linked to the do-
main of correction. Unchained animality could be mastered
only by discipline and brutalizing. The theme of the animal-
madman was effectively realized in the eighteenth century,
in occasional attempts to impose a certain pedagogy on the
insane. Pinel cites the case of a “very famous monastic
establishment, in one of the southern regions of France,”
where a violent madman would be given “a precise order to
change”; if he refused to go to bed or to eat, he “was
warned that obstinacy in his deviations would be punished
on the next day with ten strokes of the bullwhip.” If, on
the contrary, he was submissive and docile, he was allowed
“to take his meals in the refectory, next to,the disciplinar-
ian,” but at the least transgression, he was instantly ad-
monished by a “heavy blow of a rod across his fingers.”
Thus, by the use of a curious dialectic whose movement
explains all these “inhuman” practices of confinement, the
free animality of madness was tamed only by such dis-
cipline whose meaning was not to raise the bestial to the
human, but to restore man to what was purely animal
within him. Madness discloses a secret of animality which is

(75)

its own truth, and in which, in some way, it is reabsorbed.
Toward the middle of the eighteenth century, a farmer in
the north of Scotland had his hour of fame. He was said to
possess the art of curing insanity, Pinel notes in passing that
this Gregory had the physique of a Hercules: “His method
consisted in forcing the insane to perform the most difficult
tasks of farming, in using them as beasts of burden, as ser-
vants, in reducing them to an ultimate obedience with a
barrage of blows at the least act of revolt.” In the reduction
to animality, madness finds both its truth and its cure;
when the madman has become a beast, this presence of the
animal in man, a presence which constituted the scandal of
madness, is eliminated: not that the animal is silenced, but
man himself is abolished. In the human being who has be-
come a beast of burden, the absence of reason follows wis-
dom and its order: madness is then cured, since it is alien-
ated in something which is no less than its truth.

A moment would come when, from this animality of
madness, would be deduced the idea of a mechanistic psy-
chology, and the notion that the forms of madness can be
referred to the great structures of animal life. But in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the animality that
lends its face to madness in no way stipulates a determinist
nature for its phenomena. On the contrary, it locates mad-
ness in an area of unforeseeable freedom where frenzy is
unchained; if determinism can have any effect on it, it is in
the form of constraint, punishment, or discipline. Through
animality, madness does not join the great laws of nature
and of life, but rather the thousand forms of a bestiary. But
unlike the one popular in the Middle Ages, which illus-
trated, in so many symbolic visages, the metamorphoses of
evil, this was an abstract bestiary; here evil no longer as-
sumed its fantastic body; here we apprehend only its most
extreme form, the truth of the beast which is a truth with-
out content. Evil is freed from all that its wealth of icono-

(76)

graphic fauna could do, to preserve only a general power of
intimidation: the secret danger of an animaliry chat lies in
wait and, all at once, undoes reason in violence and truth in
the madman’s frenzy. Despite the contemporary effort to
constitute a positivist zoology, this obsession with an an-
imality perceived as the natural locus of madness continued
to people the hell of the classical age. It was this obsession
that created the imagery responsible for all the practices of
confinement and the strangest aspects of its savagery.

It has doubtless been essential to Western culture to link,
as it has done, its perception of madness to the iconographic
forms of the relation of man to beast. From the start,
Western culture has not considered it evident that animals
participate in the plenitude of nature, in its wisdom and its
order: this idea was a late one and long remained on the
surface of culture; perhaps it has not yet penetrated very
deeply into the subterranean regions of the imagination. In
fact, on close examination, it becomes evident that the
animal belongs rather to an anti-nature, to a negativity that
threatens order and by its frenzy endangers the positive
wisdom of nature. The work of Lautréamont bears witness
to this. Why should the fact that Western man has lived
for two thousand years on his definition as a rational animal
necessarily mean that he has recognized the possibility of an
order common to reason and to animality? Why should he
have necessarily designated, by this definition, the way in
which he inserts himself in natural positiviry? Indepen-
dently of what Aristotle really meant, may we not assume
that for the West this “rational animal” has long been the
measure of the way in which reason’s freedom functioned
in the locus of unreason, diverging from it until it consti-
tuted its opposite term? From the moment philosophy be-
came anthropology, and man sought to recognize himself
in a natural plenitude, the animal lost its power of negativ-
ity, in order to become, between the determinism of nature

(77)

 
  

Mavpness & CIVILIZATION

and the reason of man, the positive form of an evolution.
The formula of the “rational animal” has utterly changed
its meaning: the unreason it suggested as the origin of all
possible reason has entirely disappeared, Henceforth mad-
ness must obey the determinism of man perceived as a natu-
ral being in his very animality. In the classical age, if it is
true that the scientific and medical analysis of madness, as
we shall see below, sought to establish ic within this natural
mechanism, the real practices that concern the insane bear
sufficient witness to the fact that madness was still con-
tained in the anti-natural violence of animality.

In any case, it was this animality of madness which con-
finement glorified, at the same time that it sought to avoid
the scandal inherent in the immorality of the unreasonable.
Which reveals the distance established in the classical age
between madness and the other forms of unreason, even if
it is true that from a certain point of view they had been
identified or assimilated. If a whole range of unreason was
reduced to silence, but madness left free to speak the lan-
guage of its scandal, what lesson could it teach which un-
reason as a whole was not capable of transmitting? What
meaning had the frenzies and all the fury of the insane,
which could not be found in the—probably more sen-
sible—remarks of the other internees? In what respect
then was madness more particularly significant?

Beginning with the seventeenth century, unreason in the
most general sense no longer had much instructive value.
That perilous reversibility of reason which was still so close
for the Renaissance was to be forgotten, and its scandals
were to disappear. The great theme of the madness of the
Cross, which belonged so intimately to the Christian ex-
perience of the Renaissance, began to disappear in the sev-
enteenth century, despite Jansenism and Pascal. Or rather, it
subsisted, but changed and somehow inverted its meaning.

(78)
 The Insane

It was no longer a matter of requiring human reason to
abandon its pride and its certainties in order to lose itself in
the great unreason of sacrifice. When classical Christianity
speaks of the madness of the Cross, it is merely to humiliate
false reason and add luster to the eternal light of truth; the
madness of God-in-man’s-image is simply a wisdom not
recognized by the men of unreason who live in this world:
“Jesus crucified . . . was the scandal of the world and ap-
peared as nothing but ignorance and madness to the eyes of
his time.” But the fact that the world has become Christian,
and that the order of God is revealed through the meander-
ings of history and the madness of men, now suffices to
show that “Christ has become the highest point of our wis-
dom.”* The scandal of Christian faith and Christian abase-
ment, whose strength and value as revelation Pascal still
preserved, would soon have no more meaning for Christian
thought except perhaps to reveal in these scandalized con-

" sciences so many blind souls: “Do not permit your Cross,
which has subdued the universe for you, to be still the
madness and scandal of proud minds.” Christian unreason
was relegated by Christians themselves into the margins of
a reason that had become identical with the wisdom of
God incarnate. After Port-Royal, men would have to wait
two centuries—until Dostoievsky and Nietzsche—for Christ
to regain the glory of his madness, for scandal to recover its
power as revelation, for unreason to cease being merely the
public shame of reason,

But at the very moment Christian reason rid itself of the
madness that had so long been a part of itself, the madman,
in his abolished reason, in the fury of his animality, re-
ceived a singular power as a demonstration: it was as if
scandal, driven out of that superhuman region where ic
related to God and where the Incarnation was manifested,
reappeared, in the plenitude of its force and pregnant with a
new lesson, in that region where man has a relation to na-

(79)

ture and to his animality. The Jesson’s point of application
has shifted to the lower regions of madness. The Cross is no
longer to be considered in its scandal; but it must not be
forgotten that throughout his human life Christ honored
madness, sanctified it as he sanctified infirmity cured, sin
forgiven, poverty assured of eternal riches. Saint Vincent
de Paul reminds those assigned to tend the mad within the
houses of confinement that their “rule in this is Our Lord
who chose to be surrounded by lunatics, demoniacs, mad-
men, the tempted and the possessed.” These men ruled by
the powers of the inhuman constitute, around those who
represent eternal Wisdom, around the Man who incarnates
it, a perpetual occasion for glorification: because they
glorify, by surrounding it, the wisdom that has been denied
them, and at the same time give it a pretext to humiliate
itself, to acknowledge that it is granted only by grace. Fur-
ther: Christ did not merely choose to be surrounded by
lunatics; he himself chose to pass in their eyes for a mad-
man, thus experiencing, in his incarnation, all the sufferings
of human misfortune. Madness thus became the ultimate
form, the final degree of God in man’s image, before the
fulfillment and deliverance of the Cross:“O my Savior, you
were pleased to be a scandal to the Jews, and a madness to
the Gentiles; you were pleased to seem out of your senses,
as it is reported in the Holy Gospel that it was thought of
Our Lord that he had gone mad. Dicebant quoniam in
furorem versus est. His Apostles sometimes looked upon
him as a man in anger, and he seemed such to them, so that
they should bear witness that he had borne with all our
infirmities and all our states of affliction, and to teach them
and us as well to have compassion upon those who fall into
these infirmities.”*° Coming into this world, Christ agreed
to take upon himself all the signs of the human condition
and the very stigmata of fallen nature; from poverty to

death, he followed the Jong road of the Passion, which was
also the road of the passions, of wisdom forgotten, and of
madness, And because it was one of the forms of the Pas-
sion—the ultimate form, in a sense, before death—madness
would now become, for those who suffered it, an object of
respect and compassion.

To respect madness is not to interpret it as the involun-
tary and inevitable accident of disease, but to recognize this
lower limit of human truth, a limit not accidental but essen-
tial. As death is the limit of human life in the realm of time,
madness is its limit in the realm of animalicy, and just as
death had been sanctified by the death of Christ, madness,
in its most bestial nature, had also been sanctified. On
March 29, 1654, Saint Vincent de Paul announced to Jean
Barreau, himself a congreganist, that his brother had just
been confined at Saint-Lazare as a lunatic: “We must
honor Our Lord in the state wherein He was when they
sought to bind Him, saying quoniam in frenesim versus est,
in order to sanctify that state in those whom His Divine
Providence has placed there.”"* Madness is the lowest
point of humanity to which God submitted in His incarna-
tion, thereby showing that there was nothing inhuman in
man that could not be redeemed and saved; the ultimate
point of the Fall was glorified by the divine presence: and
it is this lesson which, for the seventeenth century, all mad-
ness stil! taught.

We see why the scandal of madness could be exalted,
while that of the other forms of unreason was concealed
with so much care. The scandal of unreason produced only
the contagious example of transgression and immorality;
the scandal of madness showed men how close to animality
their Fall could bring them; and at the same time how far
divine mercy could extend when it consented to save man.
For Renaissance Christianity, the entire instructive value of

(82)

 

 
  

 

Mavness & CIVILIZATION

unreason and of its scandals lay in the madness of the In-
carnation of God in man. For classicism, the Incarnation is
no longer madness; but what is madness is this incarnation
of man in the beast, which is, as the ultimate point of his
Fall, the most manifest sign of his guilt; and, as the ulamate
object of divine mercy, the symbol of universal forgiveness
and innocence regained. Henceforth, all the lessons of mad-
ness and the power of its instruction must be sought in this
obscure region, at the lower confines of humanity, where
man is hinged to nature, where he is both ultimate downfall
and absolute innocence. Does not the Church’s solicitude
for the insane during the classical period, as it is symbolized
in Saine Vincent de Paul and his Congregation, or in the
Brothers of Charity, all those religious orders hovering
over madness and showing it to the world—does this not
indicate that the Church found in madness a difficult but an
essential lesson: the guilty innocence of the animal in man?
This is the lesson to be read and understood in its spec-
tacles, in which it exalted in the madman the fury of the
human beast. Paradoxically, this Christian consciousness of
animality prepared the moment when madness would be
treated as a fact of nature; it would then be quickly for-
gotten what this “nature” meant for classical thought: not
the always accessible domain of an objective analysis, but
that region in which there appears, for man, the always
possible scandal of a madness that is both his ultimate truth
and the form of his abolition.

All these phenomena, these strange practices woven
around madness, these usages which glorify and at the same
time discipline it, reduce it to animality while making it
teach the lesson of the Redemption, put madness in a
strange position with regard to unreason as a whole. In the
houses of confinement, madness cohabits with all the forms

(82)
  

The Insane

of unreason which envelop it and define its most general
truth; and yet madness is isolated, treated in a special man-
ner, manifested in its singularity as if, though belonging to
unreason, it nonetheless traversed that domain by a move-
ment peculiar to itself, ceaselessly referring from itself to its
most paradoxical extreme.

We have now got in the habit of perceiving in madness a
fall into a determinism where all forms of liberty are gradu-
ally suppressed; madness shows us nothing more than the
natural constants of a determinism, with the sequences of
its causes, and the discursive movement of its forms; for
madness threatens modern man only with that return to the
bleak world of beasts and things, to their fetrered freedom.
It is not on this horizon of nature that the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries recognized madness, but against a
background of Unreason; madness did not disclose a mech-
anism, but revealed a liberty raging in the monstrous forms
of animality, We no longer understand unreason today,
except in its epithetic form: the Unreasonable, a sign at-
tached to conduct or speech, and betraying to the layman's
eyes the presence of madness and all its pathological train;
for us the unreasonable is only one of madness’s modes of
appearance. On the contrary, unreason, for classicism, had
a nominal value; it constituted 2 kind of substantial func-
tion. It was in relation to unreason and to it alone that
madness could be understood. Unreason was its support; or
let us say that unreason defined the locus of madness’s pos-
sibility. For classical man, madness was not the natural con-
dition, the human and psychological root of unreason; it
was only unreason’s empirical form; and the madman,
tracing the course of human degradation to the frenzied
nadir of animality, disclosed that underlying realm of un-
reason which threatens man and envelops—at a tremendous
distance--all the forms of his natural existence. It was not a

(83)

question of tending toward a determinism, but of being
swallowed up by a darkness. More effectively than any
other kind of rationalism, better in any case than our posi~
tivism, classical rationalism could watch out for and guard
against the subterranean danger of unreason, that threaten-
ing space of an absolute freedom,
